Tim McGraw,Taylor Swift,"He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie""
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night

[Pre-Chorus]
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

[Chorus]
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Verse 2]
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back

[Pre-Chorus]
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

[Chorus]
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Bridge]
And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read

[Chorus]
Is, ""When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place""
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
[Outro]
Oh, think of me, mmm
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie""",he said the way my blue eyes shined put those georgia stars to shame that night i said thats a lie just a boy in a chevy truck that had a tendency of gettin stuck on backroads at night and i was right there beside him all summer long and then the time we woke up to find that summer gone but when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think my favorite song the one we danced to all night long the moon like a spotlight on the lake when you think happiness i hope you think that little black dress think of my head on your chest and my old faded blue jeans when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think of me september saw a month of tears and thankin god that you werent here to see me like that but in a box beneath my bed is a letter that you never read from three summers back its hard not to find it all a little bittersweet and lookin back on all of that its nice to believe when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think my favorite song the one we danced to all night long the moon like a spotlight on the lake when you think happiness i hope you think that little black dress think of my head on your chest and my old faded blue jeans when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think of me and im back for the first time since then im standin on your street and theres a letter left on your doorstep and the first thing that youll read is when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think my favorite song someday youll turn your radio on i hope it takes you back to that place when you think happiness i hope you think that little black dress think of my head on your chest and my old faded blue jeans when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think of me oh think of me mmm he said the way my blue eyes shined put those georgia stars to shame that night i said thats a lie,said way blue eyes shined put georgia stars shame night said thats lie boy chevy truck tendency gettin stuck backroads night right beside summer long time woke find summer gone think tim mcgraw hope think favorite song one danced night long moon like spotlight lake think happiness hope think little black dress think head chest old faded blue jeans think tim mcgraw hope think september saw month tears thankin god werent see like box beneath bed letter never read three summers back hard find little bittersweet lookin back nice believe think tim mcgraw hope think favorite song one danced night long moon like spotlight lake think happiness hope think little black dress think head chest old faded blue jeans think tim mcgraw hope think im back first time since im standin street theres letter left doorstep first thing youll read think tim mcgraw hope think favorite song someday youll turn radio hope takes back place think happiness hope think little black dress think head chest old faded blue jeans think tim mcgraw hope think oh think mmm said way blue eyes shined put georgia stars shame night said thats lie,tim mcgraw
Picture to Burn,Taylor Swift,"State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Verse 2]
There's no time for tears, I'm just sittin' here planning my revenge
There's nothing stoppin' me from goin' out with all of your best friends
And if you come around sayin' sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show ya how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time

[Bridge]
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard

Teardrops On My Guitar,Taylor Swift,"Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus]
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus]
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll drive home alone as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

A Place In This World,Taylor Swift,"I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

[Verse 2]
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need?
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh, yeah
But that's okay

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

But I'm ready to fly

Cold as You,Taylor Swift,"You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted

[Chorus]
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day
Just walk away, ain't no use defending
Words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

[Verse 2]
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

[Chorus]
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day
So just walk away, ain't no use defending
Words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

[Bridge]
You never did give a damn thing, honey
But I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody
If I died, died for you, died for you

[Chorus]
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day, oh
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you
Ooh-oh",you have a way of coming easily to me and when you take you take the very best of me so i start a fight cause i need to feel something and you do what you want cause im not what you wanted oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day just walk away aint no use defending words that you will never say and now that im sitting here thinking it through ive never been anywhere cold as you you put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray and i stood there loving you and wished them all away and you come away with a great little story of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day so just walk away aint no use defending words that you will never say and now that im sitting here thinking it through ive never been anywhere cold as you you never did give a damn thing honey but i cried cried for you and i know you wouldnt have told nobody if i died died for you died for you oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day oh every smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made and now that im sitting here thinking it through ive never been anywhere cold as you oohoh,way coming easily take take best start fight cause need feel something want cause im wanted oh shame rainy ending given perfect day walk away aint use defending words never say im sitting thinking ive never anywhere cold put walls paint shade gray stood loving wished away come away great little story mess dreamer nerve adore oh shame rainy ending given perfect day walk away aint use defending words never say im sitting thinking ive never anywhere cold never give damn thing honey cried cried know wouldnt told nobody died died died oh shame rainy ending given perfect day oh every smile fake condescending counting scars made im sitting thinking ive never anywhere cold oohoh,cold
The Outside,Taylor Swift,"I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

[Chorus]
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

[Verse 2]
You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now, it's all too late, so you see

[Pre-Chorus]
You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too late to do anything

[Chorus]
How can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
How can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
And I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

[Outro]

Tied Together with a Smile,Taylor Swift,"Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true
'Cause I know you

[Chorus]
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh

[Verse 2]
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket (Pocket)
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay

[Chorus]
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go

Stay Beautiful,Taylor Swift,"Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home
Saying, ""Does he know?""
Will you ever know?

[Chorus]
You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful

[Verse 2]
Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save 'em for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say, ""Hey, by the way""

[Chorus]
You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful

[Bridge]
If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold, at least you'll know

[Chorus]
You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door

Should've Said No,Taylor Swift,"It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday, I found out about you
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes

[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me

[Verse 2]
You can see that I've been cryin'
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes

[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I can't resist
Before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No, no
No, no, no, no
[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why

Mary's Song (Oh My My My),Taylor Swift,"She said I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""

[Chorus]
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh, my, my, my, my

[Verse 2]
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""

[Chorus]
Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
2 AM riding in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors 'stead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside 'til the morning light
Oh, my, my, my, my

[Bridge]
A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee

[Chorus]
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said, ""I do,"" and I did, too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I

[Outro]
And I'll be eighty-seven, you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh, my, my, my",she said i was seven and you were nine i looked at you like the stars that shined in the sky the pretty lights and our daddies used to joke about the two of us growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes and said oh my my my take me back to the house in the backyard tree said youd beat me up you were bigger than me you never did you never did take me back when our world was one block wide i dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried just two kids you and i oh my my my my well i was sixteen when suddenly i wasnt that little girl you used to see but your eyes still shined like pretty lights and our daddies used to joke about the two of us they never believed wed really fall in love and our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes and said oh my my my take me back to the creek beds we turned up 2 am riding in your truck and all i need is you next to me take me back to the time we had our very first fight the slamming of doors stead of kissing goodnight you stayed outside til the morning light oh my my my my a few years had gone and come around we were sitting at our favorite spot in town and you looked at me got down on one knee take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle our whole town came and our mamas cried you said i do and i did too take me home where we met so many years before well rock our babies on that very front porch after all this time you and i and ill be eightyseven youll be eightynine ill still look at you like the stars that shine in the sky oh my my my,said seven nine looked like stars shined sky pretty lights daddies used joke two us growing falling love mamas smiled rolled eyes said oh take back house backyard tree said youd beat bigger never never take back world one block wide dared kiss ran tried two kids oh well sixteen suddenly wasnt little girl used see eyes still shined like pretty lights daddies used joke two us never believed wed really fall love mamas smiled rolled eyes said oh take back creek beds turned 2 riding truck need next take back time first fight slamming doors stead kissing goodnight stayed outside til morning light oh years gone come around sitting favorite spot town looked got one knee take back time walked aisle whole town came mamas cried said take home met many years well rock babies front porch time ill eightyseven youll eightynine ill still look like stars shine sky oh,mary's song (oh my)
Our Song,Taylor Swift,"I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song""
And he says

[Chorus]
Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

[Verse 2]
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

[Chorus]
Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

[Post-Chorus]
Da-da-da-da

[Bridge]
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for somethin' to come along
That was as good as our song

[Chorus]
'Cause our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss him and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again
[Post-Chorus]
Play it again, oh yeah
Oh-oh, yeah

[Outro]
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin

I'm Only Me When I'm With You,Taylor Swift,"Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes, we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

[Chorus]
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

[Verse 2]
Just a small-town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all, nobody gets me like you do

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

[Chorus]
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

[Bridge]
When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
And only you can tell

[Chorus]
That I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you

Invisible,Taylor Swift,"She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by

[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

[Chorus]
And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

Oh, yeah, oh

[Verse 2]
There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through

And everything that we could be

A Perfectly Good Heart,Taylor Swift,"Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?

Maybe I should've seen the signs
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall

No matter what you say
I still can't believe that you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but

I Heart ?,Beautiful Eyes,"Wish I had concentrated
They said love was complicated
But it's something I just fell into
And it was overrated
But just look what I've created
I came out alive but I'm black and blue

[Pre-Chorus]
Before you ask me if I'm alright
Think about what I had to do, yeah

[Chorus]
Wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart, put on my makeup
Another mess I didn't plan
And I'll bet you thought you'd beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an ""I heart question mark""
Written on the back of my hand

[Verse 2]
I'd be fine if you just walked by
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right
But I can't believe you made me
Sit at home, cry like a baby
Wait right by the phone every night

[Pre-Chorus]
And now you ask about you and I
There's no you and I
Remember what you put me through, I had to

[Chorus]
Wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart, put on my makeup
Another mess I didn't plan
And I'll bet you thought you'd beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an ""I heart question mark""
Written on the back of my hand

[Bridge]
And when you're home all alone at night
You'll still wonder why
You took everything I had, oh, baby
I haven't thought about you and I
There's no you and I
And I know someday you will

[Chorus]
Wake up and smell the breakup
Realize that we won't make up
It didn't go the way you planned

Fifteen (Taylor's Version),Fearless (Taylor's Version),"You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
At fifteen

[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin around, well
In your life you'll do things greater than
Datin' the boy on the football team
I didn't know it at fifteen

[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back
And tell yourself what you know now

[Verse 3]
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
But I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen
[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la

Love Story (Taylor's Version),Fearless (Taylor's Version),"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'""

Hey Stephen (Taylor's Version),Fearless (Taylor's Version),"Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceivin'
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked, we were talkin'
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believin'
I don't always have to be alone

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Post-Chorus]
Mm, mmm
Oh-woah, mmm

[Verse 2]
Hey Stephen, I've been holdin' back this feelin'
So I've got some things to say to you, huh
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leavin'?
I think you and I should stay the same

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, mmm

[Bridge]
They're dimming the street lights
You're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waitin' alone now
So come on and come out
And pull me near
And shine, shine, shine
[Verse 3]
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you? Haha

[Chorus]
I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else

White Horse (Taylor's Version),Fearless (Taylor's Version),"Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you

[Pre-Chorus]
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Verse 2]
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
Well, my mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand

[Pre-Chorus]
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, well now I know

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Bridge]
And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rearview mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

Oh, woah, woah, woah

You Belong With Me (Taylor's Version),Fearless (Taylor's Version),"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's goin' off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench, thinking to myself
""Hey, isn't this easy?""
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what you doin' with a girl like that?

[Pre-Chorus]
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standin' by and waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you
Driving to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs and you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you see? (Ah)
You belong with me
Standin' by and waitin' at your back door

Now I don't know what to be without you around

Breathe without you, but I have to

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Colbie Caillat]

Tell Me Why (Taylor's Version),Fearless (Taylor's Version),"I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feelin' like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

[Verse 2]
Well, you could write a book on
How to ruin someone's perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

[Bridge]
Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?

[Chorus]
Well, I'm sick and tired of your attitude
Feelin' like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me and cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

[Post-Chorus]
Why
Tell me why, oh

You're Not Sorry (Taylor's Version),Fearless (Taylor's Version),"All this time, I was wastin', hopin' you would come around

And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinkin' we'll be fine again, but not this time around

[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone

Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
You're lookin' so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waitin' in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets and I'm tired of bein' last to know, oh
And now you're askin' me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone

The Way I Loved You (Taylor's Version),Fearless (Taylor's Version),"He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear
And it's like I couldn't ask for anything better

[Pre-Chorus]
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, ""You look beautiful tonight""
And I feel perfectly fine

[Chorus]
But I miss screamin' and fightin' and kissin' in the rain
And it's 2 AM and I'm cursin' your name
So in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and comin' undone
It's a, a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Verse 2]
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

[Chorus]
But I miss screamin' and fightin' and kissin' in the rain
And it's 2 AM and I'm cursin' your name
So in love that you act insane

It's a, a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Bridge]
He can't see the smile I'm fakin'
And my heart's not breakin'
'Cause I'm not feelin' anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating, intoxicatin', complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

[Chorus]
I miss screamin' and fightin' and kissin' in the rain
It's 2 AM and I'm cursin' your name
So in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you

Forever & Always (Taylor's Version),Fearless (Taylor's Version),"Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto somethin'
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kiddin'?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
'Cause, one second, it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always,"" oh
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""

[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say somethin' way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothin'
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always,"" oh
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""

[Post-Chorus]
You didn't mean it, baby
I don't think so
Oh, woah

[Bridge]
Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

[Chorus]
'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all

The Best Day (Taylor's Version),Fearless (Taylor's Version),"I'm five years old, it's gettin' cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smilin' at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides, look, now the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

[Chorus]
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

[Verse 2]
I'm thirteen now and don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home cryin' and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names

[Chorus]
I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughin' on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

[Bridge]
I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out, he's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

[Verse 3]
There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talkin' to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves
Daddy's smart and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

[Chorus]
Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for givin' me your eyes
For staying back and watchin' me shine
And I didn't know if you knew
So I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today",im five years old its gettin cold ive got my big coat on i hear your laugh and look up smilin at you i run and run past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides look now the sky is gold i hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home i dont know why all the trees change in the fall but i know youre not scared of anything at all dont know if snow whites house is near or far away but i know i had the best day with you today im thirteen now and dont know how my friends could be so mean i come home cryin and you hold me tight and grab the keys and we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away and we talk and window shop til ive forgotten all their names i dont know who im gonna talk to now at school but i know im laughin on the car ride home with you dont know how long its gonna take to feel okay but i know i had the best day with you today i have an excellent father his strength is making me stronger god smiles on my little brother inside and out hes better than i am i grew up in a pretty house and i had space to run and i had the best days with you there is a video i found from back when i was three you set up a paint set in the kitchen and youre talkin to me its the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves daddys smart and youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world now i know why all the trees change in the fall i know you were on my side even when i was wrong and i love you for givin me your eyes for staying back and watchin me shine and i didnt know if you knew so im taking this chance to say that i had the best day with you today,im five years old gettin cold ive got big coat hear laugh look smilin run run past pumpkin patch tractor rides look sky gold hug legs fall asleep way home dont know trees change fall know youre scared anything dont know snow whites house near far away know best day today im thirteen dont know friends could mean come home cryin hold tight grab keys drive drive found town far enough away talk window shop til ive forgotten names dont know im gonna talk school know im laughin car ride home dont know long gonna take feel okay know best day today excellent father strength making stronger god smiles little brother inside hes better grew pretty house space run best days video found back three set paint set kitchen youre talkin age princesses pirate ships seven dwarves daddys smart youre prettiest lady whole wide world know trees change fall know side even wrong love givin eyes staying back watchin shine didnt know knew im taking chance say best day today,best day (taylor's version)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
So we've been outnumbered, raided and, now, cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared

[Pre-Chorus]
You can walk away, say, ""We don't need this""
But there's somethin' in your eyes, says, ""We can beat this""

[Chorus]
'Cause these things will change, can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh-woah

[Bridge]
Tonight, we'll stand and get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

[Chorus]
It was the night things changed, can you see it now?
When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up 'cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah, oh

Come In With The Rain (Taylor's Version),Fearless (Taylor's Version),"I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky

And let me know what you find

'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know, I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain

Talk to the man who put you here

You smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row
Scream your name

[Chorus]

Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall

The Other Side of the Door (Taylor's Version),Fearless (Taylor's Version),"In the heat of the fight, I walked away
Ignorin' words that you were sayin', tryna make me stay
I said, ""This time I've had enough""
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not pickin' up

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm so mad, I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

[Chorus]
I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window, throwin' pebbles
Screamin', ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

[Verse 2]
Well, me and my stupid pride are sittin' here alone
Goin' through the photographs, starin' at the phone
I keep goin' back over things we both said
And I remember the slammin' door
And all the things that I misread

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, babe, if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah

[Chorus]
I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin', ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

[Bridge]
And I'll scream out the window
""I can't even look at you""
I don't need you, but I do, I do, I do
I say, ""There's nothin' you can say
To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it""
But what I mean is

[Chorus]
I said, ""Leave,"" but, baby, all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin', ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
[Outro]
With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down cryin', was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything, I must confess
I need you",in the heat of the fight i walked away ignorin words that you were sayin tryna make me stay i said this time ive had enough and youve called a hundred times but im not pickin up cause im so mad i might tell you that its over but if you look a little closer i said leave but all i really want is you to stand outside my window throwin pebbles screamin im in love with you wait there in the pourin rain comin back for more and dont you leave cause i know all i need is on the other side of the door well me and my stupid pride are sittin here alone goin through the photographs starin at the phone i keep goin back over things we both said and i remember the slammin door and all the things that i misread oh babe if you know everything tell me why you couldnt see when i left i wanted you to chase after me yeah i said leave but all i really want is you to stand outside my window throwin pebbles screamin im in love with you wait there in the pourin rain comin back for more and dont you leave cause i know all i need is on the other side of the door and ill scream out the window i cant even look at you i dont need you but i do i do i do i say theres nothin you can say to make this right again i mean it i mean it but what i mean is i said leave but baby all i want is you to stand outside my window throwin pebbles screamin im in love with you wait there in the pourin rain comin back for more and dont you leave cause i know all i need is on the other side of the door with your face and the beautiful eyes and the conversation with the little white lies and the faded picture of a beautiful night you carried me from your car up the stairs and i broke down cryin was she worth this mess after everything and that little black dress after everything i must confess i need you,heat fight walked away ignorin words sayin tryna make stay said time ive enough youve called hundred times im pickin cause im mad might tell look little closer said leave really want stand outside window throwin pebbles screamin im love wait pourin rain comin back dont leave cause know need side door well stupid pride sittin alone goin photographs starin phone keep goin back things said remember slammin door things misread oh babe know everything tell couldnt see left wanted chase yeah said leave really want stand outside window throwin pebbles screamin im love wait pourin rain comin back dont leave cause know need side door ill scream window cant even look dont need say theres nothin say make right mean mean mean said leave baby want stand outside window throwin pebbles screamin im love wait pourin rain comin back dont leave cause know need side door face beautiful eyes conversation little white lies faded picture beautiful night carried car stairs broke cryin worth mess everything little black dress everything must confess need,side door (taylor's version)
Today Was a Fairytale (Taylor's Version),Fearless (Taylor's Version),"Today was a fairytale, you were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray T-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around

[Chorus]
Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

[Verse 2]
Today was a fairytale, you've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make, everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, all that I can say
Is, now it's gettin' so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah

It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
But can you feel this magic in the air?

You All Over Me (Taylor's Version) [From the Vault],Fearless (Taylor's Version),"Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain? But I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls, you know
You can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]
I lived and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]
The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your ""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin
Well I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child
Now, every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]
And I lived and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]
I lived and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

[Outro: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]
I've still got you all over me
Still got you all over me",once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement shouldnt i find a stain but i never do the way the tires turn stones on old county roads they leave em muddy underneath reminds me of you you find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls you know you can scratch it right off its how it used to be but like the dollar in your pocket its been spent and traded in you cant change where its been reminds me of me i lived and i learned had you got burned held out and held on god knows too long and wasted time lost tears swore that id get out of here but no amount of freedom gets you clean ive still got you all over me the best and worst day of june was the one that i met you with your hands in your pockets and your dont you wish you had me grin well i did so i smiled and i melted like a child now every breath of air i breathe reminds me of then and i lived and i learned had you got burned held out and held on god knows too long and wasted time lost tears swore that id get out of here but no amount of freedom gets you clean ive still got you all over me i lived and i learned and found out what it was to turn around and see that we were never really meant to be so i lied and i cried and i watched a part of myself die cause no amount of freedom gets you clean ive still got you all over me ive still got you all over me still got you all over me,last drop rain dried pavement shouldnt find stain never way tires turn stones old county roads leave em muddy underneath reminds find graffiti walls old bathroom stalls know scratch right used like dollar pocket spent traded cant change reminds lived learned got burned held held god knows long wasted time lost tears swore id get amount freedom gets clean ive still got best worst day june one met hands pockets dont wish grin well smiled melted like child every breath air breathe reminds lived learned got burned held held god knows long wasted time lost tears swore id get amount freedom gets clean ive still got lived learned found turn around see never really meant lied cried watched part die cause amount freedom gets clean ive still got ive still got still got,(taylor's version) [from vault]
Mr. Perfectly Fine (Taylor's Version) [From the Vault],Fearless (Taylor's Version),"Mr. ""Perfect face,"" Mr. ""Here to stay""
Mr. ""Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away""
Everything was right, Mr. ""I've been waitin' for you all my life""
Mr. ""Every single day until the end, I will be by your side""

[Pre-Chorus]
But that was when I got to know Mr. ""Change of heart""
Mr. ""Leaves me all alone,"" I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay

[Chorus]
Hello, Mr. ""Perfectly fine""
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. ""Always at the right place at the right time,"" baby
Hello, Mr. ""Casually cruel""
Mr. ""Everything revolves around you""
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Mr. ""Perfectly fine""

[Verse 2]
Mr. ""Never told me why,"" Mr. ""Never had to see me cry""
Mr. ""Insincere apology, so he doesn't look like the bad guy""
He goes about his day, forgets he ever even heard my name
Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same

[Pre-Chorus]
Because I hear he's got his arm 'round a brand-new girl
I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her
And I never got past what you put me through
But it's wonderful to see that it never phased you

[Chorus]
Hello, Mr. ""Perfectly fine""
How's your heart after breakin' mine?

Hello, Mr. ""Casually cruel""
Mr. ""Everything revolves around you""
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Mr. ""Perfectly fine""

[Bridge]
So dignified in your well-pressed suit
So strategized, all the eyes on you
Sashay your way to your seat
It's the best seat in the best room
Oh, he's so smug, Mr. ""Always wins""
So far above me in every sense
So far above feelin' anything
And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame
'Cause I was Miss ""Here to stay""
Now I'm Miss ""Gonna be alright someday""
And someday, maybe you'll miss me
But by then, you'll be Mr. ""Too late""
[Chorus]
Goodbye, Mr. ""Perfectly fine""
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. ""Always at the right place at the right time,"" baby
Goodbye, Mr. ""Casually cruel""
Mr. ""Everything revolves around you""
I've been Miss Misery for the last time

We Were Happy (Taylor's Version) [From the Vault],Fearless (Taylor's Version),"We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shinin' bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy
I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy

[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

[Verse 2]
We used to watch the Sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder
'Cause we were happy

[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

[Post-Chorus]
We were happy

[Bridge]
Oh, I hate those voices
Tellin' me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices
And that's what these tears are for

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we were happy
We were happy

[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
And we were happy

That's When (Taylor's Version) [From the Vault],Fearless (Taylor's Version),"You said, ""I know""
When I said, ""I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this""
And you watched me go
And I knew my words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I said, ""When can I-I-I come back?""

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And you said, ""That's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or stormin'
Laughin', when I'm cryin'
And that's when
I'll be waitin' at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in and, baby, that's when""

[Post-Chorus: Keith Urban]
Mmm, mm

[Verse 2: Keith Urban, Taylor Swift, Keith Urban & Taylor Swift]
I said, ""I know""
When you said, ""I did you wrong, made mistakes
And put you through all of this"" (Through all of this)
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said, ""Leave those all in our past""

[Pre-Chorus: Keith Urban]
And you said, ""When can I-I-I come back?""

[Chorus: Keith Urban, Taylor Swift, Keith Urban & Taylor Swift]
And I said, ""That's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or stormin'
Laughin', when I'm cryin'
And that's when
I'll be waitin' at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in and, baby, that's when""

[Bridge: Taylor Swift]
And you said, ""Honestly
When you were gone
Did you ever think of me?""

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Keith Urban]
And I said, ""That's when
When I woke up in the morning
That's when it was sunny or stormin'
Laughin', when I was cryin'
And that's when
You were waitin' at the front gate
That's when, when I saw your face
You let me in, and baby, that's when""
[Outro: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Keith Urban]

Don't You (Taylor's Version) [From the Vault],Fearless (Taylor's Version),"Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere
It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare
I heard she's nothin' like me
I'm sure she'll make you happy

[Chorus]
But don't you
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I really wish that I could hate you
I've tried, but that's just somethin' I can't do
My heart knows what the truth is
I swore I wouldn't do this

[Chorus]
But don't you
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

[Bridge]
So I'll walk out of here tonight
Try to go on with my life
And you can say we're still friends
(But I don't wanna pretend)
So if I see you again

Don't you (Don't you)
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been

Bye Bye Baby (Taylor's Version) [From the Vault],Fearless (Taylor's Version),"It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm drivin' away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
'Cause I, I still love you, but I can't

[Chorus]
Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, baby

[Verse 2]
The picture frame is empty
On the dresser, vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash
Then back to your hesitation
I was so sure of everything
Everything I thought we'd always have
Guess I never doubted it
Then the here and the now floods in
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past

[Chorus]
Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye, bye, baby

[Bridge]
And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want, but it's not enough this time
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends

[Chorus]
Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me

[Chorus]

Mine (Taylor's Version),Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

[Verse 1]
You were in college working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

[Pre-Chorus]
I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Verse 2]
Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

[Pre-Chorus]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh

[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause it's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone"" (Oh)
[Chorus]
You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
(Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Outro]
Do you believe it? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We're gonna make it now (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Sparks Fly (Taylor's Version),Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of

[Chorus]
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Verse 2]
My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really somethin'
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you, I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would

[Chorus]
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Bridge]
I'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a fireworks show

[Chorus]
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Back To December (Taylor's Version),Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughin' from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand

[Chorus]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

Speak Now (Taylor's Version),Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry

[Pre-Chorus]
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""

[Verse 2]
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

[Pre-Chorus]
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don't you?

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""
Don't say yes, run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow)
Your time is running out
And they said, ""Speak now""

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh (Run away now), la
Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh

[Bridge]
I hear the preacher say
""Speak now or forever hold your peace""
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only lookin' at you
[Verse 3]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha

[Chorus]
So, don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
They said, ""Speak now""
And you say, ""Let's run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when I'm out
Of my tux, at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow)

Dear John (Taylor's Version),Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"Long were the nights
When my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Prayin' the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losin' my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you change the rules every day
Wonderin' which version of you
I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up
And this song is to let you know why

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shoulda known

[Verse 2]
Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played by
Your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
I shoulda known

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
You are an expert at ""Sorry"" and keepin' lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you run dry have tired, lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town
Oh

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You shoulda known
[Outro]
You shoulda known
Don't you think I was too young?
You shoulda known",long were the nights when my days once revolved around you counting my footsteps prayin the floor wont fall through again and my mother accused me of losin my mind but i swore i was fine you paint me a blue sky then go back and turn it to rain and i lived in your chess game but you change the rules every day wonderin which version of you i might get on the phone tonight well i stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why dear john i see it all now that youre gone dont you think i was too young to be messed with the girl in the dress cried the whole way home i shoulda known well maybe its me and my blind optimism to blame or maybe its you and your sick need to give love and take it away and youll add my name to your long list of traitors who dont understand and ill look back and regret how i ignored when they said run as fast as you can dear john i see it all now that youre gone dont you think i was too young to be messed with the girl in the dress cried the whole way home dear john i see it all now it was wrong dont you think nineteens too young to be played by your dark twisted games when i loved you so i shoulda known you are an expert at sorry and keepin lines blurry never impressed by me acing your tests all the girls that you run dry have tired lifeless eyes cause you burned them out but i took your matches before fire could catch me so dont look now im shining like fireworks over your sad empty town oh dear john i see it all now that youre gone dont you think i was too young to be messed with the girl in the dress cried the whole way home i see it all now that youre gone dont you think i was too young to be messed with the girl in the dress wrote you a song you shoulda known you shoulda known dont you think i was too young you shoulda known,long nights days revolved around counting footsteps prayin floor wont fall mother accused losin mind swore fine paint blue sky go back turn rain lived chess game change rules every day wonderin version might get phone tonight well stopped pickin song let know dear john see youre gone dont think young messed girl dress cried whole way home shoulda known well maybe blind optimism blame maybe sick need give love take away youll add name long list traitors dont understand ill look back regret ignored said run fast dear john see youre gone dont think young messed girl dress cried whole way home dear john see wrong dont think nineteens young played dark twisted games loved shoulda known expert sorry keepin lines blurry never impressed acing tests girls run dry tired lifeless eyes cause burned took matches fire could catch dont look im shining like fireworks sad empty town oh dear john see youre gone dont think young messed girl dress cried whole way home see youre gone dont think young messed girl dress wrote song shoulda known shoulda known dont think young shoulda known,dear john (taylor's version)
Mean (Taylor's Version),Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feelin' like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Verse 2]
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Bridge]
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big, loud opinion, but nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same ole bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean

[Buildup]
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic
And alone in life, and mean
And mean, and mean, and mean
[Chorus]
But someday, I'll be livin' in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big ole city

The Story Of Us (Taylor's Version),Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, ""They're the lucky ones""
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now I'm searchin' the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

[Chorus]
Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

[Post-Chorus]
Next chapter

[Verse 2]
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and tryin' to look busy
And you're doin' your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losin' my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothin'?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

[Chorus]
Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

[Bridge]
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you said you'd rather love than fight
[Pre-Chorus]
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

[Chorus]
Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me? Yeah
And I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'Cause we're goin' down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

Never Grow Up (Taylor's Version),Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite nightlight

[Pre-Chorus]
To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

[Chorus]
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up

[Post-Chorus]
And never grow up

[Verse 2]
You're in the car, on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's droppin' you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots

[Pre-Chorus]
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's gettin' older, too
And don't lose the way that you dance around
In your PJs getting ready for school

[Chorus]
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
And no one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up

[Bridge]
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is, someday, gonna be gone

[Verse 3]
So, here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
[Chorus]
Wish I'd never grown up
Wish I'd never grown up
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, I could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, it could still be simple
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you (Never grow up)
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please, try to never grow up

Enchanted (Taylor's Version),Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Verse 3]
The lingering question kept me up
2 a.m., who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
""Hey, it was enchanting to meet you""
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Bridge]
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you
Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)
Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you (Oh-oh)

[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck (Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you)
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Better Than Revenge (Taylor's Version),Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did (Ha)
Haha, time for a little revenge

[Verse 1]
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with (Oh)
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealin' from

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge (Revenge), ha

[Verse 2]
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
They didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
That no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge (Haha)

[Bridge]
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
Woah (Come on, can you take it back? Come on)

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think (No)
She's an actress, woah (You know that you deserve this)
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge
[Outro]
(Come on) Do you still feel like you know what you're doin'?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)
Come on, show me how much better you are (Oh, oh)

Innocent (Taylor's Version),Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back

[Pre-Chorus]
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?

[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

[Verse 2]
Did some things you can't speak of
But at night, you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

[Pre-Chorus]
Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up, too, ooh
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new
Oh, oh

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent

Haunted (Taylor's Version),Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"You and I walk a fragile line

But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all so quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

And he just might make me smile

Last Kiss (Taylor's Version),Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
Away
I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms

[Pre-Chorus]
But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be somethin' you miss

[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Verse 2]
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showin' off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancin', but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake meetin' my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll go
Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be somethin' you miss

[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips, mmm

[Bridge]
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

[Verse 3]
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll go
Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be somethin' you miss
[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Outro]
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last",i still remember the look on your face lit through the darkness at 158 the words that you whispered for just us to know you told me you loved me so why did you go away away i do recall now the smell of the rain fresh on the pavement i ran off the plane that july ninth the beat of your heart it jumps through your shirt i can still feel your arms but now ill go sit on the floor wearin your clothes all that i know is i dont know how to be somethin you miss i never thought wed have a last kiss i never imagined wed end like this your name forever the name on my lips i do remember the swing of your step the life of the party youre showin off again and id roll my eyes and then youd pull me in im not much for dancin but for you i did because i love your handshake meetin my father i love how you walk with your hands in your pockets how youd kiss me when i was in the middle of saying something theres not a day i dont miss those rude interruptions and ill go sit on the floor wearin your clothes all that i know is i dont know how to be somethin you miss i never thought wed have a last kiss i never imagined wed end like this your name forever the name on my lips mmm so ill watch your life in pictures like i used to watch you sleep and i feel you forget me like i used to feel you breathe and ill keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are hope its nice where you are and i hope the sun shines and its a beautiful day and something reminds you you wish you had stayed you can plan for a change in the weather and time but i never planned on you changing your mind so ill go sit on the floor wearin your clothes all that i know is i dont know how to be somethin you miss i never thought wed have a last kiss i never imagined wed end like this your name forever the name on my lips just like our last kiss forever the name on my lips forever the name on my lips just like our last,still remember look face lit darkness 158 words whispered us know told loved go away away recall smell rain fresh pavement ran plane july ninth beat heart jumps shirt still feel arms ill go sit floor wearin clothes know dont know somethin miss never thought wed last kiss never imagined wed end like name forever name lips remember swing step life party youre showin id roll eyes youd pull im much dancin love handshake meetin father love walk hands pockets youd kiss middle saying something theres day dont miss rude interruptions ill go sit floor wearin clothes know dont know somethin miss never thought wed last kiss never imagined wed end like name forever name lips mmm ill watch life pictures like used watch sleep feel forget like used feel breathe ill keep old friends ask hope nice hope sun shines beautiful day something reminds wish stayed plan change weather time never planned changing mind ill go sit floor wearin clothes know dont know somethin miss never thought wed last kiss never imagined wed end like name forever name lips like last kiss forever name lips forever name lips like last,last kiss (taylor's version)
Long Live (Taylor's Version),Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"I said, ""Remember this moment""
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Remember this feeling""
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishin' for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Bridge]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Will you take a moment? Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please, tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you
[Chorus]
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Singing, ""Long live all the mountains we moved""
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered",i said remember this moment in the back of my mind the time we stood with our shaking hands the crowds in stands went wild we were the kings and the queens and they read off our names the night you danced like you knew our lives would never be the same you held your head like a hero on a history book page it was the end of a decade but the start of an age long live the walls we crashed through how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you i was screaming long live all the magic we made and bring on all the pretenders one day we will be remembered i said remember this feeling i pass the pictures around of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines wishin for right now we are the kings and the queens you traded your baseball cap for a crown when they gave us our trophies and we held them up for our town and the cynics were outraged screaming this is absurd cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world long live the walls we crashed through how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you i was screaming long live all the magic we made and bring on all the pretenders im not afraid long live all the mountains we moved i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you i was screaming long live that look on your face and bring on all the pretenders one day we will be remembered hold on to spinning around confetti falls to the ground may these memories break our fall will you take a moment promise me this that youll stand by me forever but if god forbid fate should step in and force us into a goodbye if you have children some day when they point to the pictures please tell em my name tell em how the crowds went wild tell em how i hope they shine long live the walls we crashed through i had the time of my life with you long long live the walls we crashed through how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you and i was screaming long live all the magic we made and bring on all the pretenders im not afraid singing long live all the mountains we moved i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you and long long live that look on your face and bring on all the pretenders one day we will be remembered,said remember moment back mind time stood shaking hands crowds stands went wild kings queens read names night danced like knew lives would never held head like hero history book page end decade start age long live walls crashed kingdom lights shined screaming long live magic made bring pretenders one day remembered said remember feeling pass pictures around years stood sidelines wishin right kings queens traded baseball cap crown gave us trophies held town cynics outraged screaming absurd cause moment band thieves ripped jeans got rule world long live walls crashed kingdom lights shined screaming long live magic made bring pretenders im afraid long live mountains moved time life fighting dragons screaming long live look face bring pretenders one day remembered hold spinning around confetti falls ground may memories break fall take moment promise youll stand forever god forbid fate step force us goodbye children day point pictures please tell em name tell em crowds went wild tell em hope shine long live walls crashed time life long long live walls crashed kingdom lights shined screaming long live magic made bring pretenders im afraid singing long live mountains moved time life fighting dragons long long live look face bring pretenders one day remembered,long live (taylor's version)
Ours (Taylor's Version),Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

[Verse 2]
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
And you'll say

Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

[Bridge]
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard

Superman (Taylor's Version),Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"Tall, dark, and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say
And you smile and say, ""How are you?""
And I'll say, ""Just fine""
I always forget to tell you, ""I love you""
I love you forever

[Chorus]
I watch Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watch Superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

[Verse 2]
Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away, and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say
And you'll leave, got places to be, and I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you, ""I love you""
I loved you from the very first day

[Chorus]
I watch Superman fly away

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away, but I never let you go
I'm love-struck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be

[Breakdown]
Right here, wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you
'Cause I loved you from the very first day

Got a history of stories ending sadly
Still hoping that the fire won't burn me
Just one time, just one time

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm

[Verse 2: Patrick Stump, Taylor Swift & Patrick Stump]
I've been left in the rain lost and pining
I'm tryin' hard not to look like I'm trying
'Cause every time I tried hard for love, it fell apart (Woah)
I've gotten used to no one callin' my phone
I've grown accustomed to sleepin' alone
Still, I know that all it takes is to get it right
Just one time, just one time

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Patrick Stump]
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Patrick Stump]
I was thinking just one time (Just one time)
Maybe the stars align (Just one time)
And maybe I call you mine
And you won't need space
Or string me along while you decide
And just one time (Just one time)
Maybe the moment's right (The moment's right)
It's 8:05 and I see two headlights

[Chorus: Both, Taylor Swift, Patrick Stump]
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch (Ooh)
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life (Life)
And I want you now, wanna need you forever

When Emma Falls in Love (Taylor's Version) [From The Vault],Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"When Emma falls in love, she paces the floor
Closes the blinds and locks the door
When Emma falls in love, she calls up her mom
Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong
She waits and takes her time
'Cause Little Miss Sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain
When Emma falls in love, I know
That boy will never be the same

[Chorus]
'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her

[Verse 2]
When Emma falls in love, it's all on her face
Hangs in the air like stars in outer space
When Emma falls in love, she disappears
And we all just laugh after seein' it all these years
When Emma falls apart, it's when she's alone
She takes on the pain and bears it on her own
'Cause when Emma falls in love, she's in it for keeps
She won't walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave

[Chorus]
And she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her

[Bridge]
Well, she's so New York when she's in L.A.
She won't lose herself in love the way that I did
'Cause she'll call you out, she'll put you in your place
When Emma falls in love, I'm learning

[Verse 3]
Emma met a boy with eyes like a man
Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand
Now he'll be her shelter when it rains
Little does he know, his whole world's about to change

[Chorus]
'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her

I Can See You (Taylor's Version) [From The Vault],Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"I-I-I-I

[Verse 1]
You brush past me in the hallway
And you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya?
I've been watchin' you for ages
And I spend my time tryin' not to feel it

[Pre-Chorus]
But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?

[Chorus]
'Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you

[Post-Chorus]
I-I-I-I

[Verse 2]
And we kept everything professional
But something's changed, it's somethin' I, I like
They keep watchful eyes on us
So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet
You won't believe half the things I see inside my head
Wait 'til you see half the things that haven't happened yet

[Pre-Chorus]
But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?

And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew, oh, oh, oh

I could see you, make me want you even more
What would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you

[Post-Chorus]
I-I-I-I

[Bridge]
I can see you in your suit and your necktie
Passed me a note sayin', ""Meet me tonight""
Then we kiss and you know I won't ever tell, yeah
And I could see you being my addiction
You can see me as a secret mission
Hide away and I will start behaving myself

[Pre-Chorus]
I-I-I-I
Oh-oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
I can see you waitin' down the hall from me

Castles Crumbling (Taylor's Version) [From The Vault],Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"(Once, I had an empire)
(Once, I had an empire)
(Once, I had an empire)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Once, I had an empire in a golden age
I was held up so high, I used to be great
They used to cheer when they saw my face
Now, I fear I have fallen from grace

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams]
And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
You don't wanna know me now

[Verse 2: Hayley Williams, Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams]
Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty
Crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me
Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too far
I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams, Taylor Swift]
Power went to my head and I couldn't stop
Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off
And here I sit alone behind walls of regret
Falling down like promises that I never kept

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams, Taylor Swift]
And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
You don't wanna know me now

[Bridge: Taylor Swift]
My foes and friends watch my reign end
I don't know how it could've ended this way
Smoke billows from my ships in the harbor
People look at me like I'm a monster
Now they're screamin' at the palace front gates
Used to chant my name
Now they're screaming that they hate me
Never wanted you to hate me

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams]
My castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down (Just let you down)
My castle's crumbling down
You don't wanna know me now, now

Foolish One (Taylor's Version) [From The Vault],Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"My cards are on the table, yours are in your hand
Chances are, tonight, you've already got plans
And chances are I will talk myself to sleep again
You give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high
Wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right
And I will block out these voices of reason in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
And the voices say, ""You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson""

[Chorus]
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down

[Verse 2]
You know how to keep me waitin'
I know how to act like I'm fine
Don't know what to call this situation
But I know I can't call you mine
And it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof
'Cause when my head is on your shoulder
It starts thinkin' you'll come around
And maybe, someday, when we're older
This is something we'll laugh about
Over coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news

[Pre-Chorus]
But then the voices say, ""You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson""

[Chorus]
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out

[Bridge]
Now I'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands
Sayin', ""How could I not see the signs?""
Oh, you haven't written me or called
But goodbye screamin' in the silence
And the voices in my head are tellin' me why
'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings
I'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring
And you will say you had the best of intentions
And maybe I will finally learn my lesson

[Chorus]
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out, oh-oh, oh, oh
[Outro]
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, oh
La-la-la-la-la
Ain't never gonna come
Ooh, you will learn the hard way now
Foolish one
Sittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love
They ain't never gonna come
And thinkin' he's the one, you should've been walkin' out
Foolish one
The day is gonna come for your confessions of love

Timeless (Taylor's Version) [From The Vault],Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"Down the block, there's an antique shop
And something in my head said, ""Stop,"" so I walked in
On the counter was a cardboard box
And the sign said, ""Photos: twenty-five cents each""
Black and white, saw a 30s bride
And school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house
The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime
The kind you don't put down

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain
But in those photos, I saw us instead
And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other
In another life, you still would've turned my head even if we'd met

[Chorus]
On a crowded street in 1944
And you were headed off to fight in the war
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right
And you would've been fine
We would have been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless

[Verse 2]
I had to smile when it caught my eye
There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway
Holdin' hands on the way to a dance
And the date on the back said 1958
Which brought me back to the first time I saw you
Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop
I thought about it as I started lookin' 'round
At these precious things that time forgot

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs
Story of a romance torn apart by fate
Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did
And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face

[Chorus]
In the 1500s, off in a foreign land
And I was forced to marry another man
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And run away and left it all behind
You still would've been mine
We would've been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless
[Bridge]
Time breaks down your mind and body
Don't you let it touch your soul
It was like an age-old classic
The first time that you saw me
The story started when you said, ""Hello""

[Chorus]
In a crowded room a few short years ago
And sometimes there's no proof, you just know
You're always gonna be mine
We're gonna be
I'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' gray
We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made
And you'll say, ""Oh my, we really were timeless""

[Post-Chorus]
We're gonna be timeless, timeless
You still would've been mine
We would've been
Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944
You still would've been mine
We would've been

[Outro]

State of Grace (Taylor's Version),Red (Taylor's Version),"I'm walkin' fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

[Chorus]
And I never (I never)
Saw you comin'
And I'll never (I'll never)
Be the same

[Verse 2]
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

[Chorus]
And I never (I never)
Saw you comin'
And I'll never (I'll never)
Be the same

[Bridge]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of somethin' good
And right and real

[Chorus]
And I never (I never)
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same, oh-oh-oh
And I never (I never)

Red (Taylor's Version),Red (Taylor's Version),"Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red (Red, red)
(Red, red)
But loving him was red (Red, red)
(Red, red)

[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red (Red, red)
Oh, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)

[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible when I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

[Chorus]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red (Red, red)
Yeah, yeah, red (Red, red)
Oh, burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)

[Post-Chorus]
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head (Red, red)
Comes back to me, burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)
Yeah, yeah (Red, red)

Treacherous (Taylor's Version),Red (Taylor's Version),"Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it

[Verse 2]
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
All we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction

[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I-I-I like it

[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you a -  get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should -  think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous

I Knew You Were Trouble (Taylor's Version),Red (Taylor's Version),"Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me-e-e-e-e-e

[Pre-Chorus]
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Verse 2]
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see-e-e-e-e-e

[Pre-Chorus]
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey

That you never loved me

All Too Well (Taylor's Version),Red (Taylor's Version),"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well
[Verse 4]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

You remember it all

""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, we called it off again last night, but
Ooh, this time, I'm tellin' you, I'm tellin' you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever gettin' back together
We are never, ever, ever gettin' back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together

[Post-Chorus]
Like, ever

[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you pickin' fights
And me fallin' for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine (Haha)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you called me up again tonight, but
Ooh, this time, I'm tellin' you, I'm tellin' you (Oh)

[Chorus]
We (We) are never, ever, ever gettin' back together
We are never, ever, ever (Ever) gettin' back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh (Yeah), ooh (Yeah)
Ooh (Yeah), oh

[Bridge]
I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's, like, ""I still love you""
And I'm, like, I'm just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together
Like, ever (No)

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever gettin' back together

Stay Stay Stay (Taylor's Version),Red (Taylor's Version),"I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Stay, stay, stay""
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

[Verse 2]
Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me

[Chorus]
No choice but to stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

[Bridge]
You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you
All the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you
For my whole life

[Chorus]
Stay
And I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

[Outro]

The Last Time (Taylor's Version),Red (Taylor's Version),"I find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I'm not sure how I got there
All roads, they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

[Pre-Chorus: Gary Lightbody & Taylor Swift]
And right before your eyes
I'm breakin'
No past, no reasons why
Just you and me

[Chorus: Gary Lightbody & Taylor Swift]

Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm askin' you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
You find yourself at my door
And just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

[Pre-Chorus: Gary Lightbody & Taylor Swift]
And right before your eyes
I'm achin'
No past, nowhere to hide
Just you and me

[Chorus: Gary Lightbody & Taylor Swift]

Holy Ground (Taylor's Version),Red (Taylor's Version),"I was reminiscing just the other day
While havin' coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feelin' on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

[Chorus]
And darlin', it was good
Never lookin' down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Verse 2]
Spinnin' like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big, wide city all to ourselves
We block the noise with the sound of, ""I need you""
And for the first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But, sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

[Chorus]
'Cause, darlin', it was good (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
Never lookin' down (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
And right there where we stood (Ooh-ayy)
Was holy ground

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah
Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah

[Bridge]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancin' with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancin' with you

[Chorus]
It was good
I'm never lookin' down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah
Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah

And now, it's big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
All I knew this mornin' when I woke
Is I know something now

And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind makin' me feel like

Starlight (Taylor's Version),Red (Taylor's Version),"I said, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancin', dancin'
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

[Verse 1]
I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picks me up late one night, out the window
We were seventeen and crazy, runnin' wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playin' when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretendin' to be a duchess and a prince

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancin', dancin'
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

[Verse 2]
He said, ""Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change""
""You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinkin' that way""
He was tryin' to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?""
""Don't you dream impossible things?""

[Chorus]
Like, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancin', dancin'
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, he's talkin' crazy
Ooh, ooh, dancin' with me
Ooh, ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh-hoo-hoo)
(Ooh-hoo-hoo)
(Ooh-hoo-hoo)
(Ooh-hoo-hoo)

[Chorus]
Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancin', dancin'
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
[Outro]
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?",i said oh my what a marvelous tune it was the best night never would forget how he moved the whole place was dressed to the nines and we were dancin dancin like were made of starlight like were made of starlight i met bobby on the boardwalk summer of 45 picks me up late one night out the window we were seventeen and crazy runnin wild wild cant remember what song it was playin when we walked in the night we snuck into a yacht club party pretendin to be a duchess and a prince and i said oh my what a marvelous tune it was the best night never would forget how he moved the whole place was dressed to the nines and we were dancin dancin like were made of starlight starlight like were made of starlight starlight he said look at you worrying too much about things you cant change youll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinkin that way he was tryin to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me dont you see the starlight starlight dont you dream impossible things like oh my what a marvelous tune it was the best night never would forget how he moved the whole place was dressed to the nines and we were dancin dancin like were made of starlight starlight like were made of starlight starlight ooh ooh hes talkin crazy ooh ooh dancin with me ooh ooh we could get married have ten kids and teach em how to dream oohhoohoo oohhoohoo oohhoohoo oohhoohoo oh my what a marvelous tune it was the best night never would forget how he moved the whole place was dressed to the nines and we were dancin dancin like were made of starlight starlight like were made of starlight starlight like were made of starlight starlight like we dream impossible dreams like starlight starlight like we dream impossible dreams dont you see the starlight starlight dont you dream impossible things,said oh marvelous tune best night never would forget moved whole place dressed nines dancin dancin like made starlight like made starlight met bobby boardwalk summer 45 picks late one night window seventeen crazy runnin wild wild cant remember song playin walked night snuck yacht club party pretendin duchess prince said oh marvelous tune best night never would forget moved whole place dressed nines dancin dancin like made starlight starlight like made starlight starlight said look worrying much things cant change youll spend whole life singing blues keep thinkin way tryin skip rocks ocean saying dont see starlight starlight dont dream impossible things like oh marvelous tune best night never would forget moved whole place dressed nines dancin dancin like made starlight starlight like made starlight starlight ooh ooh hes talkin crazy ooh ooh dancin ooh ooh could get married ten kids teach em dream oohhoohoo oohhoohoo oohhoohoo oohhoohoo oh marvelous tune best night never would forget moved whole place dressed nines dancin dancin like made starlight starlight like made starlight starlight like made starlight starlight like dream impossible dreams like starlight starlight like dream impossible dreams dont see starlight starlight dont dream impossible things,starlight (taylor's version)
Begin Again (Taylor's Version),Red (Taylor's Version),"Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song, but I do, I do

[Verse 2]
I walked in, expectin' you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave, I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do

[Chorus]
And you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spendin' the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

[Verse 3]
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm comin' off a little shy, but I do

[Chorus]
But you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spendin' the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

[Bridge]
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

[Chorus]
'Cause you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spendin' the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

The Moment I Knew (Taylor's Version),Red (Taylor's Version),"You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars that just align
And I would've been so happy
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waitin' for you to walk in
But the time is tickin'
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughin'
As I'm lookin' around the room
But there was one thing missin'
And that was the moment I knew

[Verse 2]
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's somethin' really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feelin' starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughin'
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missin'
And that was the moment I knew

[Bridge]
What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?
[Breakdown]
You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standin' around me, singin'
""Happy birthday to you""
But there was one thing missin'
And that was the moment I knew

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh) Oh, I knew
(Oh)

[Outro]
You called me later
And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it""
And I said, ""I'm sorry too""
And that was the moment I knew",you shouldve been there shouldve burst through the door with that baby im right here smile and it wouldve felt like a million little shining stars that just align and i wouldve been so happy christmas lights glisten ive got my eye on the door just waitin for you to walk in but the time is tickin people ask me how ive been as i comb back through my memory how you said youd be here you said youd be here and it was like slow motion standing there in my party dress in red lipstick with no one to impress and theyre all laughin as im lookin around the room but there was one thing missin and that was the moment i knew and the hours pass by now i just wanna be alone but your close friends always seem to know when theres somethin really wrong so they follow me down the hall and there in the bathroom i try not to fall apart and the sinking feelin starts as i say hopelessly he said hed be here and it was like slow motion standing there in my party dress in red lipstick with no one to impress and theyre all laughin and asking me about you but there was one thing missin and that was the moment i knew what do you say when tears are streaming down your face in front of everyone you know and what do you do when the one who means the most to you is the one who didnt show you shouldve been here and i wouldve been so happy and it was like slow motion standing there in my party dress in red lipstick with no one to impress and theyre all standin around me singin happy birthday to you but there was one thing missin and that was the moment i knew oh oh i knew oh you called me later and said im sorry i didnt make it and i said im sorry too and that was the moment i knew,shouldve shouldve burst door baby im right smile wouldve felt like million little shining stars align wouldve happy christmas lights glisten ive got eye door waitin walk time tickin people ask ive comb back memory said youd said youd like slow motion standing party dress red lipstick one impress theyre laughin im lookin around room one thing missin moment knew hours pass wanna alone close friends always seem know theres somethin really wrong follow hall bathroom try fall apart sinking feelin starts say hopelessly said hed like slow motion standing party dress red lipstick one impress theyre laughin asking one thing missin moment knew say tears streaming face front everyone know one means one didnt show shouldve wouldve happy like slow motion standing party dress red lipstick one impress theyre standin around singin happy birthday one thing missin moment knew oh oh knew oh called later said im sorry didnt make said im sorry moment knew,moment knew (taylor's version)
Come Back...Be Here (Taylor's Version),Red (Taylor's Version),"You said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

[Pre-Chorus]
I told myself, ""Don't get attached""
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

[Chorus]
And this is when the feelin' sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

[Verse 2]
The delicate beginnin' rush
The feelin' you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant

[Pre-Chorus]
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

[Chorus]
And this is when the feelin' sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is fallin' for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here
But you're in London and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around
[Chorus]
This is when the feelin' sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
I don't wanna miss you like this
Oh, oh

Girl At Home (Taylor's Version),Red (Taylor's Version),"Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
[Verse 1]
I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

[Pre-Chorus]
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This, I have previously learned

[Chorus]
So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

[Verse 2]
I just wanna make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

[Pre-Chorus]
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her

Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Wanna see you pick up your phone

Ronan (Taylor's Version),Red (Taylor's Version),"I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the Moon and back
I remember your blue eyes lookin' into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancin' before bedtime
Then jumpin' on me, waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

[Chorus]
""Come on, baby, with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years""

[Verse 2]
I remember the drive home when the blind hope
Turned to cryin' and screamin', ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween, you could be anything
You wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

[Chorus]
""Come on, baby, with me
We're gonna fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray
We'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years""

[Bridge]
What if I'm standin' in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
And what if the miracle was even gettin' one moment with you?

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, with me
We're gonna fly away from here
Come on, baby, with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

Better Man (Taylor's Version) [From The Vault],Red (Taylor's Version),"I know I'm probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn't know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish it wasn't 4AM, standin' in the mirror
Saying to myself, ""You know you had to do it""
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

[Verse 2]
I know I'm probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute
And it was always on your terms, I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again like it was in the beginning

[Pre-Chorus]
But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now
Talking down to me like I'd always be around
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh, you never thought I'd run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

[Bridge]
I hold onto this pride because, these days, it's all I have
And I gave to you my best
And we both know you can't say that

[Breakdown]
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would've become if you were a better man
We might still be in love if you were a better man
You would've been the one if you were a better man

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
(Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again)
We might still be in love, if you were a better man
(But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man)
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
[Outro]
We might still be in love if you were a better man
You would've been the one if you were a better man",i know im probably better off on my own than lovin a man who didnt know what he had when he had it and i see the permanent damage you did to me never again i just wish i could forget when it was magic i wish it wasnt 4am standin in the mirror saying to myself you know you had to do it i know the bravest thing i ever did was run sometimes in the middle of the night i can feel you again but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man i know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man a better man i know im probably better off all alone than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute and it was always on your terms i waited on every careless word hoping they might turn sweet again like it was in the beginning but your jealousy oh i can hear it now talking down to me like id always be around push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun oh you never thought id run sometimes in the middle of the night i can feel you again but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man i know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man a better man i hold onto this pride because these days its all i have and i gave to you my best and we both know you cant say that i wish you were a better man i wonder what we wouldve become if you were a better man we might still be in love if you were a better man you wouldve been the one if you were a better man sometimes in the middle of the night i can feel you again but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man i know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man a better man sometimes in the middle of the night i can feel you again we might still be in love if you were a better man but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man i know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man a better man we might still be in love if you were a better man you wouldve been the one if you were a better man,know im probably better lovin man didnt know see permanent damage never wish could forget magic wish wasnt 4am standin mirror saying know know bravest thing ever run sometimes middle night feel miss wish better man know say goodbye like back hand miss wish better man better man know im probably better alone needing man could change mind given minute always terms waited every careless word hoping might turn sweet like beginning jealousy oh hear talking like id always around push love away like kind loaded gun oh never thought id run sometimes middle night feel miss wish better man know say goodbye like back hand miss wish better man better man hold onto pride days gave best know cant say wish better man wonder wouldve become better man might still love better man wouldve one better man sometimes middle night feel miss wish better man know say goodbye like back hand miss wish better man better man sometimes middle night feel might still love better man miss wish better man know say goodbye like back hand miss wish better man better man might still love better man wouldve one better man,better man (taylor's version) [from vault]
Nothing New (Taylor's Version) [From The Vault],Red (Taylor's Version),"They tell you while you're young
""Girls, go out and have your fun""
Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
Criticize the way you fly
When you're soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say, ""She looks like she's been through it""

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Lord, what will become of me
Once I've lost my novelty?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I've had too much to drink tonight
And I know it's sad, but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everythin' at eighteen
But nothin' at twenty-two?
And will you still want me
When I'm nothing new?
[Verse 2: Phoebe Bridgers]
How long will it be cute, all this cryin' in my room?
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention?

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Phoebe Bridgers]
And someone else lights up the room (Ah)
People love an ingénue (Ah)

[Chorus: Phoebe Bridgers, Taylor Swift]
I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
How did I go from growin' up to breaking down?
And I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time movin'
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me
When I'm nothing new?

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Both, Phoebe Bridgers]
I know someday I'm gonna meet her, it's a fever dream
The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
She'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me
I'll say I'm happy for her, then I'll cry myself to sleep
Oh, woah, oh (Oh)
Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh (Oh)

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Phoebe Bridgers, Both]
I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out
I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night
And I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me
Will you still want me
Will you still want me

I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor's Version) [From the Vault],Red (Taylor's Version),"3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills

[Verse 4: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
Mr. Superior Thinkin'
Do you have all the space that you need?
I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy
And I bet you think about me

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me

[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
Oh, block it all out
The voices so loud, sayin'
""Why did you let her go?""
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that you're lookin' for
Is the love that you had?

[Verse 5: Taylor Swift]
Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet it's hard to believe
But it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And, yeah, I bet you think about me
[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me

[Outro: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
I bet you think about me when you're out
At your cool indie music concerts every week
I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch
I bet you think about me when you say
""Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me""
I bet you think about me",3 am and im still awake ill bet youre just fine fast asleep in your city thats better than mine and the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree and ill bet your friends tell you shes better than me huh well i tried to fit in with your uppercrust circles yeah they let me sit in back when we were in love oh they sit around talkin about the meaning of life and the book that just saved em that i hadnt heard of but now that were done and its over i bet you couldnt believe when you realized im harder to forget than i was to leave and i bet you think about me you grew up in a silverspoon gated community glamorous shiny bright beverly hills i was raised on a farm no it wasnt a mansion just livin room dancin and kitchen table bills but you know what they say you cant help who you fall for and you and i fell like an early spring snow but reality crept in you said were too different you laughed at my dreams rolled your eyes at my jokes mr superior thinkin do you have all the space that you need i dont have to be your shrink to know that youll never be happy and i bet you think about me i bet you think about me yes i bet you think about me oh block it all out the voices so loud sayin why did you let her go does it make you feel sad that the love that youre lookin for is the love that you had now youre out in the world searchin for your soul scared not to be hip scared to get old chasing makebelieve status last time you felt free was when none of that shit mattered cause you were with me but now that were done and its over i bet its hard to believe but it turned out im harder to forget than i was to leave and yeah i bet you think about me i bet you think about me yes i bet you think about me i bet you think about me when youre out at your cool indie music concerts every week i bet you think about me in your house with your organic shoes and your milliondollar couch i bet you think about me when you say oh my god shes insane she wrote a song about me i bet you think about me,3 im still awake ill bet youre fine fast asleep city thats better mine girl bed fine pedigree ill bet friends tell shes better huh well tried fit uppercrust circles yeah let sit back love oh sit around talkin meaning life book saved em hadnt heard done bet couldnt believe realized im harder forget leave bet think grew silverspoon gated community glamorous shiny bright beverly hills raised farm wasnt mansion livin room dancin kitchen table bills know say cant help fall fell like early spring snow reality crept said different laughed dreams rolled eyes jokes mr superior thinkin space need dont shrink know youll never happy bet think bet think yes bet think oh block voices loud sayin let go make feel sad love youre lookin love youre world searchin soul scared hip scared get old chasing makebelieve status last time felt free none shit mattered cause done bet hard believe turned im harder forget leave yeah bet think bet think yes bet think bet think youre cool indie music concerts every week bet think house organic shoes milliondollar couch bet think say oh god shes insane wrote song bet think,bet think (taylor's version) [from vault]
Forever Winter (Taylor's Version) [From The Vault],Red (Taylor's Version),"He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
He says, ""Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?""
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity

[Pre-Chorus]
I call, just checkin' up on him
He's up, 3AM, pacin'
He says, ""It's not just a phase I'm in""
My voice comes out beggin'

[Chorus]
All this time, I didn't know
You were breakin' down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

[Verse 2]
He seems fine most of the time, forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony, when the lights go out, it's hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead

[Pre-Chorus]
I call, just checkin' up on him
He's up, 5AM, wasted
Long gone, not even listening
My voice comes out screamin'

[Chorus]
All this time, I didn't know
You were breakin' down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

[Bridge]
If I was standing there in your apartment
I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it
I'd say, ""I love you even at your darkest and
Please, don't go""

[Chorus]
I didn't know
You were breakin' down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go
[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'll be your summer sun forever
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) At 3AM, pacin'
All this time, I didn't know
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) At 5AM, wasted
I'd be in pieces on the floor
Forever winter if you go

Give me the keys, I'll bring the car back around
We shouldn't be in this town
And my so-called friends, they don't know
I'd drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and don't say no, no

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
There's a chain 'round your throat, piece of paper where I wrote
""I'll wait for you""

So you laugh like a child
And I'll sing like no one cares
No one to be and no one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and don't say no, no

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket
Since I gave it to you
There's a heart on your sleeve, I'll take it when I leave

Like you'd run from the law

The Very First Night (Taylor's Version) [From The Vault],Red (Taylor's Version),"I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

[Verse 1]
And so it goes
Every weekend, this same party
I never go alone
And I don't seem broken-hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
They weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don't know how much I miss you

[Chorus]
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

[Verse 2]
And so it was
We never saw it comin'
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children runnin'
Back then, we didn't know
We were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo
Then we broke each other's hearts

[Pre-Chorus]
But don't forget about the night out in L.A
Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway
No one knows about the words that we whispered
No one knows how much I miss you

[Chorus]
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

[Post-Chorus]
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you
[Bridge]
I remember the night at the hotel
I was ridin' in the car when we both fell
I'm the one on the phone as you whisper
""Do you know how much I miss you?""

[Breakdown]
I wish that we could go back in time
And I'd say to you
""I miss you like it was the very first night""

[Chorus]
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

[Post-Chorus]
Take me away (Take me), take me away (Take me)
Take me away (Take me) to you, to you
Take me away (Take me), take me away (Take me)
Take me away (Take me) to you, to you",i wish i could fly id pick you up and wed go back in time id write this in the sky i miss you like it was the very first night and so it goes every weekend this same party i never go alone and i dont seem brokenhearted my friends all say they know everything im going through i drive down different roads but they all lead back to you cause they dont know about the night in the hotel they werent ridin in the car when we both fell didnt read the note on the polaroid picture they dont know how much i miss you i wish i could fly id pick you up and wed go back in time id write this in the sky i miss you like it was the very first night and so it was we never saw it comin not trying to fall in love but we did like children runnin back then we didnt know we were built to fall apart we broke the status quo then we broke each others hearts but dont forget about the night out in la dance in the kitchen chase me down through the hallway no one knows about the words that we whispered no one knows how much i miss you i wish i could fly id pick you up and wed go back in time id write this in the sky i miss you like it was the very first night take me away take me away take me away to you to you take me away take me away take me away to you to you i remember the night at the hotel i was ridin in the car when we both fell im the one on the phone as you whisper do you know how much i miss you i wish that we could go back in time and id say to you i miss you like it was the very first night i wish i could fly id pick you up and wed go back in time id write this in the sky i miss you like it was the very first night take me away take me take me away take me take me away take me to you to you take me away take me take me away take me take me away take me to you to you,wish could fly id pick wed go back time id write sky miss like first night goes every weekend party never go alone dont seem brokenhearted friends say know everything im going drive different roads lead back cause dont know night hotel werent ridin car fell didnt read note polaroid picture dont know much miss wish could fly id pick wed go back time id write sky miss like first night never saw comin trying fall love like children runnin back didnt know built fall apart broke status quo broke others hearts dont forget night la dance kitchen chase hallway one knows words whispered one knows much miss wish could fly id pick wed go back time id write sky miss like first night take away take away take away take away take away take away remember night hotel ridin car fell im one phone whisper know much miss wish could go back time id say miss like first night wish could fly id pick wed go back time id write sky miss like first night take away take take away take take away take take away take take away take take away take,first night (taylor's version) [from vault]
All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) [From The Vault],Red (Taylor's Version),"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it",i walked through the door with you the air was cold but somethin bout it felt like home somehow and i left my scarf there at your sisters house and youve still got it in

Welcome To New York (Taylor's Version),1989 (Taylor's Version),"Walkin' through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted somethin' more
Searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said

""Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you""
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

Blank Space (Taylor's Version),1989 (Taylor's Version),"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 2]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin', like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (Oh-oh), mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

Style (Taylor's Version),1989 (Taylor's Version),"Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burnin' flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)

[Pre-Chorus]
I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

[Chorus]
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashin' down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashin' down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Verse 2]
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mm
Takes me home
Lights are off, he's taking off his coat, oh, yeah
I say, ""I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl""
Some other girl

[Pre-Chorus]
He says, ""What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinkin' 'bout you,"" and I
I said, ""I've been there too a few times""

[Chorus]
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashin' down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (A tight little skirt)
And when we go crashin' down, we come back every time

Out Of The Woods (Taylor's Version),1989 (Taylor's Version),"Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinkin'

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)

[Verse 2]
Looking at it now
Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
And fall back together (Back together)
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinkin'

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Oh)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)

[Bridge]
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out, I said, ""I'm settin' you free""
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were lookin' at me
You were lookin' at me, oh, you were looking at me
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?)
I remember
(Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?)
(Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good)
Oh, I remember
[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Yeah)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (Say, are we?)
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah) Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Clear yet? Good)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Do you remember?)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?

(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 1]
People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road

[Chorus]
(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand, then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late, well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (Stay)

[Verse 2]
Here you are now, callin' me up
But I don't know what to say

Of the mess you made

But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye

I Wish You Would (Taylor's Version),1989 (Taylor's Version),"It's 2 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say, ""It's in the past,"" you drive straight ahead
You're thinkin' that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

[Chorus]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

[Verse 2]
It's 2 AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
Then it makes you turn right back around

[Chorus]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fightin' for and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

Bad Blood (Taylor's Version),1989 (Taylor's Version),"'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shiny? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughin' right at me

And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey

[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kinda wounds, they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're comin' my way, just don't

Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version),1989 (Taylor's Version),"He said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""
I thought, ""Heaven can't help me now""
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

[Verse 2]
I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request it is

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Somethin' happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circlin', dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

[Verse 2]
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run

Clean (Taylor's Version),1989 (Taylor's Version),"The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth, ah-ah, ah-ah
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

[Chorus]
The rain came pouring down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

[Verse 2]
There was nothin' left to do, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof, ah-ah, ah-ah
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

[Pre-Chorus]
The water filled my lungs
I screamed so loud, but no one heard a thing

[Chorus]
The rain came pourin' down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

[Post-Chorus]
I think I am finally clean
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Ah-ah-ah

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

[Chorus]
The rain came pourin' down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
The rain came pourin' down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

Wonderland (Taylor's Version),1989 (Taylor's Version),"Flashin' lights
And we took a wrong turn
And we fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control

[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't they tell us, ""Don't rush into things""?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and excitin'?
I felt your arms twistin' around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And life was never worse, but never better, eh, eh

[Post-Chorus]
In Wonderland
In Wonderland
In Wonderland
In Wonderland

[Verse 2]
So, we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed
But there were strangers watchin'
And whispers turned to talkin'
And talking turned to screams, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't they tell us, ""Don't rush into things""?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and excitin'?
I felt your arms twistin' around me
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind
But darlin'

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And life was never worse, but never better, eh, eh

In Wonderland
In Wonderland, woah
In Wonderland
[Bridge]
I reached for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for somethin' else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end, in Wonderland, we both went mad
Oh

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Could last forever)
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)
And life was never worse, but never better (Never better)

You Are In Love (Taylor's Version),1989 (Taylor's Version),"One look, dark room, meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives, coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says, ""Look up"" and your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (See it with the lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love, you are in love

[Verse 2]
Morning, his place, burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once, you let go of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks, you fight, then you talk
One night, he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says, ""You're my best friend""
And you knew what it was, he is in love

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (See it with the lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love, you are in love

[Bridge]
And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe 'round and 'round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now
Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words

[Interlude]
'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love, you are in love

New Romantics (Taylor's Version),1989 (Taylor's Version),"We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't comin'
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better
We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doin'
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics, come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly
We are too busy dancin' to get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

[Verse 2]
We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace, ah
We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up, then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle

You part the crowd like the Red Sea

Did you get anxious though
On the way home?
I guess I'll never, ever know
Now that we don't talk

[Verse 2]
You grew your hair long
You got new icons
And from the outside
It looks like you're tryin' lives on
I miss the old ways
You didn't have to change
But I guess I don't have a say
Now that we don't talk

Remind myself, the more I gave, you'd want me less

Shared dinners, long weekends with?

Platonic, it's just ended, so

[Chorus]
I call my mom, she said to get it off my chest (Off my chest)
Remind myself the way you faded 'til I left (Until I left)
I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost (Of what I lost)
And what it cost, now that we don't talk

[Outro]
I don't have to pretend I like acid rock
Or that I'd like to be on a mega yacht
With important men who think important thoughts
Guess maybe I am better off now that we don't talk
And the only way back to my dignity
Was to turn into a shrouded mystery
Just like I had been when you were chasing me
Guess this is how it has to be now that we don't talk",you went to a party i heard from everybody you part the crowd like the red sea dont even get me started did you get anxious though on the way home i guess ill never ever know now that we dont talk you grew your hair long you got new icons and from the outside it looks like youre tryin lives on i miss the old ways you didnt have to change but i guess i dont have a say now that we dont talk i call my mom she said that it was for the best remind myself the more i gave youd want me less i cannot be your friend so i pay the price of what i lost and what it cost now that we dont talk what do you tell your friends we shared dinners long weekends with truth is i cant pretend its platonic its just ended so i call my mom she said to get it off my chest off my chest remind myself the way you faded til i left until i left i cannot be your friend so i pay the price of what i lost of what i lost and what it cost now that we dont talk i dont have to pretend i like acid rock or that id like to be on a mega yacht with important men who think important thoughts guess maybe i am better off now that we dont talk and the only way back to my dignity was to turn into a shrouded mystery just like i had been when you were chasing me guess this is how it has to be now that we dont talk,went party heard everybody part crowd like red sea dont even get started get anxious though way home guess ill never ever know dont talk grew hair long got new icons outside looks like youre tryin lives miss old ways didnt change guess dont say dont talk call mom said best remind gave youd want less cannot friend pay price lost cost dont talk tell friends shared dinners long weekends truth cant pretend platonic ended call mom said get chest chest remind way faded til left left cannot friend pay price lost lost cost dont talk dont pretend like acid rock id like mega yacht important men think important thoughts guess maybe better dont talk way back dignity turn shrouded mystery like chasing guess dont talk,talk (taylor's version) [from vault]
Suburban Legends (Taylor's Version) [From The Vault],1989 (Taylor's Version),"You had people who called you on unmarked numbers
In my peripheral vision
I let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer
All was quickly forgiven
You were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious
Flush with the currency of cool
I was always turnin' out my empty pockets
And when it came to you

[Chorus]
I didn't come here to make friends
We were born to be suburban legends
When you hold me, it holds me together
And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

[Verse 2]
I had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs
Would surprise the whole school
When I ended up back at our class reunion
Walkin' in with you
You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries
With the pages ripped out
I am standin' in a 1950s gymnasium
And I can still see you now

[Chorus]
I didn't come here to make friends
We were born to be suburban legends
When you hold me, it holds me together
And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever
I know that you still remember
We were born to be national treasures
When you told me we'd get back together
And you kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

[Outro]
Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block
I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it
Waves crash on the shore, I dash to the door
You don't knock anymore and my whole life's ruined
Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block
I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it
Waves crash to the shore, I dash to the door
You don't knock anymore and I always knew it
That my life would be ruined",you had people who called you on unmarked numbers in my peripheral vision i let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer all was quickly forgiven you were so magnetic it was almost obnoxious flush with the currency of cool i was always turnin out my empty pockets and when it came to you i didnt come here to make friends we were born to be suburban legends when you hold me it holds me together and you kiss me in a way thats gonna screw me up forever i had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs would surprise the whole school when i ended up back at our class reunion walkin in with you youd be more than a chapter in my old diaries with the pages ripped out i am standin in a 1950s gymnasium and i can still see you now i didnt come here to make friends we were born to be suburban legends when you hold me it holds me together and you kiss me in a way thats gonna screw me up forever i know that you still remember we were born to be national treasures when you told me wed get back together and you kissed me in a way thats gonna screw me up forever ticktock on the clock i pace down your block i broke my own heart cause you were too polite to do it waves crash on the shore i dash to the door you dont knock anymore and my whole lifes ruined ticktock on the clock i pace down your block i broke my own heart cause you were too polite to do it waves crash to the shore i dash to the door you dont knock anymore and i always knew it that my life would be ruined,people called unmarked numbers peripheral vision let slide like hose slippery plastic summer quickly forgiven magnetic almost obnoxious flush currency cool always turnin empty pockets came didnt come make friends born suburban legends hold holds together kiss way thats gonna screw forever fantasy maybe mismatched star signs would surprise whole school ended back class reunion walkin youd chapter old diaries pages ripped standin 1950s gymnasium still see didnt come make friends born suburban legends hold holds together kiss way thats gonna screw forever know still remember born national treasures told wed get back together kissed way thats gonna screw forever ticktock clock pace block broke heart cause polite waves crash shore dash door dont knock anymore whole lifes ruined ticktock clock pace block broke heart cause polite waves crash shore dash door dont knock anymore always knew life would ruined,suburban legends (taylor's version) [from vault]
Is It Over Now? (Taylor's Version) [From The Vault],1989 (Taylor's Version),"(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
When you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

Uh-huh

Sweeter Than Fiction (Taylor's Version),1989 (Taylor's Version),"Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh, oh
Only sound, only sound that you hear is, ""No""
You never saw it comin', slipped when you started runnin'
And now you've come undone and I, I, I, I

[Pre-Chorus]
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh, ayy
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better, someday, you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever and

[Chorus]
There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes, wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

[Verse 2]
Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh, oh
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it comin', you hit the ground runnin'
And now you're on to somethin', I, I, I say

[Pre-Chorus]
""What a sight, what a sight"" when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And, in this perfect weather, it's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus]
There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes, wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction (Woah)
There you'll stand, next to me (Next to me)
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes, wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction (Woah; Sweeter than fiction)

[Bridge]
I'll be one of the many sayin'
""Look at you now, look at you now and now""
I'll be one of the many saying
""You've made us proud, you've made us proud, proud""
I'll be one of the many sayin'
""Look at you now, look at you now and now""
I'll be one of the many sayin'
""You've made us proud, you've made us proud, proud""
And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when, when you

...Ready for It?,reputation,"Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothin' better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

[Verse 2]
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealin' hearts and runnin' off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist and
We'll move to an island and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure

Never be the same now, now

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumours, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, somethin' was born on the 4th of July
Our past days were the fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

I Did Something Bad,reputation,"I never trust a narcissist, but they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look, oh, so easy
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

[Pre-Chorus]
I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothin'
I don't regret it one bit 'cause he had it comin'

[Chorus]
They say I did somethin' bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did somethin' bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

[Post-Chorus]

Da-da, da, da

[Verse 2]
I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it comin', what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

[Pre-Chorus]
I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, ""Don't throw away a good thing""
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'

[Chorus]
They say I did somethin' bad (Da-da)
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did somethin' bad
But why's it feel so good?

So It Goes...,reputation,"See you in the dark

All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause, baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

Gorgeous,reputation,"Gorgeous

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field bein' a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)

[Pre-Chorus]
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not bein' mine

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face (Gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for makin' me feel this way
But what can I say? You're gorgeous

[Verse 2]
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talkin' to everyone here but you (But you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touchin' my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single, that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)

I feel like I might sink and drown and die

Getaway Car,reputation,"No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car

[Verse 1]
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it and you didn't see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him, I needed a reason

[Pre-Chorus]
""X"" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Shoulda known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me

[Post-Chorus]
In a getaway car (Oh-oh-oh)
No, they never get far (Oh-oh-ah)
No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car

[Verse 2]
It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin' and I was just drinkin'
While he was runnin' after us, I was screamin', ""Go, go, go""
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story and now we're both sorry (We're both sorry)

[Pre-Chorus]
""X"" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (Oh)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Shoulda known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
[Post-Chorus]
In a getaway car (Oh-oh-oh)
No, they never get far (Oh-oh-ah)
No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car

[Bridge]
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (Oh-oh)
Until I switched to the other side, to the other side
It's no surprise I turned you in (Oh-oh)
'Cause us traitors never win

[Breakdown]
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me (Oh)

[Chorus]
Drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (Shoulda known)
Shoulda known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me

King of My Heart,reputation,"I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own

We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on callin' me ""baby"" like tryin' on clothes

Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do

Dancing With Our Hands Tied,reputation,"I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, twenty-five years old
Oh, how were you to know? And
My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know? I

[Pre-Chorus]
I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothin' in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feelin'
And darlin', you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talkin', puttin' us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feelin'

[Chorus]
But we were dancin'
Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancin'

Yeah, we were dancin'
And I had a bad feelin'
But we were dancin'

I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance
Oh, through an avalanche? And
Say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity
Oh, keeping you with me, I

I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again (Again, yeah)

Dress,reputation,"Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo

[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shakin' from holdin' back from you, ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waitin'
My hands are shakin' from all this, ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Verse 2]
Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I'm spillin' wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothin' about

[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation

Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times
You could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies
You saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this, ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things,reputation,"It was so nice throwin' big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimmin' in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feelin' so Gatsby for that whole year

[Pre-Chorus]
So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates
[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darlin'
Because you break them, I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

[Verse 2]
It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shakin' my hand
And therein lies the issue, friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm)
If only you weren't so shady
[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darlin' (Yeah)
Because you break them, I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Nice things) things (Baby), honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have

[Bridge]
Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about the he-said, she-said
And here's to my baby
He ain't readin' what they call me lately
And here's to my mama
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face (This is why we can't have)
[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darlin' (Darlin')
Because you break them, I had to take them away (Away)
This is why we can't have nice (Uh, uh) things (Oh, no), honey (Baby, oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have (Oh) nice (Oh, no) things, darlin'

Because you break them, I had to take them (Away)

Call It What You Want,reputation,"My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doin' better than I ever was
'Cause

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walkin' with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Verse 2]
All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walkin' with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah

So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Bridge]
I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly, I said
""You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?""
Yes (Would you run away?)
[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walkin' with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to

Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

I want your midnights

I Forgot That You Existed,Lover,"How many days did I spend thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?

'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
And I couldn't get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
Free rent, living in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
But then something happened one magical night

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

[Verse 2]
Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show

[Pre-Chorus]
But you showed who you are, then one magical night

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

[Bridge]
Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
It's all just a blur

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed

Cruel Summer,Lover,"(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

It's blue, the feeling I've got

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth

He looks up, grinnin' like a devil

Lover,Lover,"We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)

The Man,Lover,"I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd be a fearless leader, I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya, what's that like?

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Man)
I'd be the man (Man)

[Verse 2]
They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

[Pre-Chorus]
And they would toast to me, oh (Ayy), let the players play
I'd be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Man)
I'd be the man (Man)

[Bridge]
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashin' my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So it's okay that I'm mad

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again (Comin' at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again (Comin' at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Man)
I'd be the man (Man, oh)
I'd be the man (Man, yeah)
I'd be the man (Man, I'd be the man)

The Archer,Lover,"Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

[Verse 2]
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years

[Pre-Chorus]
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)

[Bridge]
'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me

[Pre-Chorus]
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay

I Think He Knows,Lover,"I think he knows
His footprints on the sidewalk
Lead to where I can't stop
Go there every night
I think he knows
His hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like it's mine

Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince,Lover,"You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at sixteen, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl"" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

[Verse 2]
My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl"" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you
[Bridge]
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)

Paper Rings,Lover,"The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (One, two, one, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

[Verse 2]
In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)

Cornelia Street,Lover,"We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
""I rent a place on Cornelia Street""
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

[Chorus]
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Verse 2]
Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

[Pre-Chorus]
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name (City screams your name)
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
[Bridge]
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name (City screams your name)
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
[Post-Chorus]
I don't wanna lose you (Hope it never ends)
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I don't wanna lose you (Yeah)

Death By A Thousand Cuts,Lover,"My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my

[Chorus]
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse]
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?

[Chorus]
'Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Bridge]
My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you too much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

[Chorus]
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)
[Post-Chorus]
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no

[Outro]
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""",my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my my saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts flashbacks waking me up i get drunk but its not enough cause the morning comes and youre not my baby i look through the windows of this love even though we boarded them up chandeliers still flickering here cause i cant pretend its okay when its not its death by a thousand cuts i dress to kill my time i take the long way home i ask the traffic lights if itll be alright they say i dont know and what once was ours is no ones now i see you everywhere the only thing we share is this small town you said it was a great love one for the ages but if the storys over why am i still writing pages cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts flashbacks waking me up i get drunk but its not enough cause the morning comes and youre not my baby i look through the windows of this love even though we boarded them up chandeliers still flickering here cause i cant pretend its okay when its not its death by a thousand cuts my heart my hips my body my love tryna find a part of me that you didnt touch gave up on me like i was a bad drug now im searching for signs in a haunted club our songs our films united we stand our country guess it was a lawless land quiet my fears with the touch of your hand paper cut stings from our paperthin plans my time my wine my spirit my trust tryna find a part of me you didnt take up gave you too much but it wasnt enough but ill be alright its just a thousand cuts i get drunk but its not enough cause youre not my baby i look through the windows of this love even though we boarded them up chandeliers still flickering here cause i cant pretend its okay when its not no its not its death by a thousand cuts you didnt touch tryna find a part of me that you didnt touch my body my love my trust its death by a thousand cuts but it wasnt enough it wasnt enough no no i take the long way home i ask the traffic lights if itll be alright they say i dont know,saying goodbye death thousand cuts flashbacks waking get drunk enough cause morning comes youre baby look windows love even though boarded chandeliers still flickering cause cant pretend okay death thousand cuts dress kill time take long way home ask traffic lights itll alright say dont know ones see everywhere thing share small town said great love one ages storys still writing pages cause saying goodbye death thousand cuts flashbacks waking get drunk enough cause morning comes youre baby look windows love even though boarded chandeliers still flickering cause cant pretend okay death thousand cuts heart hips body love tryna find part didnt touch gave like bad drug im searching signs haunted club songs films united stand country guess lawless land quiet fears touch hand paper cut stings paperthin plans time wine spirit trust tryna find part didnt take gave much wasnt enough ill alright thousand cuts get drunk enough cause youre baby look windows love even though boarded chandeliers still flickering cause cant pretend okay death thousand cuts didnt touch tryna find part didnt touch body love trust death thousand cuts wasnt enough wasnt enough take long way home ask traffic lights itll alright say dont know,death thousand cuts
London Boy,Lover,"We can go drivin' in, on my scooter

And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey

And I say to you

False God,Lover,"We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I'd fly to you?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love

[Verse 2]
I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah

You Need To Calm Down,Lover,"You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night

[Pre-Chorus]
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

[Bridge]
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)

Afterglow,Lover,"I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something you didn't do
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
Thought I had reason to attack, but no

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there's no us
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go

It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh

I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, don't walk away, I need to say

Tell me that we'll be just fine

Tell me that it's not my fault
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say

ME!,Lover,"I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kinda guy the ladies want
(And there's a lotta cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lotta cool chicks out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Verse 2: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lotta lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lotta lame guys out there)

'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer

Daylight,Lover,"My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth but never goodbye

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearin' the air, I breathed in the smoke

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)

[Post-Chorus]
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

[Bridge]
And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneakin' in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burnin' red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)

[Post-Chorus]
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
(And I can still see it all)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(I once believed love would be burning red)
[Outro]
Like daylight
It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go
[Spoken Outro]
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I, I just think that
You are what you love",my love was as cruel as the cities i lived in everyone looked worse in the light there are so many lines that ive crossed unforgiven ill tell you the truth but never goodbye i dont wanna look at anything else now that i saw you i dont wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you ive been sleepin so long in a twentyyear dark night and now i see daylight i only see daylight luck of the draw only draws the unlucky and so i became the butt of the joke i wounded the good and i trusted the wicked clearin the air i breathed in the smoke maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down maybe ive stormed out of every single room in this town threw out our cloaks and our daggers because its morning now its brighter now now i dont wanna look at anything else now that i saw you i can never look away i dont wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you things will never be the same ive been sleepin so long in a twentyyear dark night now im wide awake and now i see daylight daylight i only see daylight daylight i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight and i can still see it all in my mind all of you all of me intertwined i once believed love would be black and white but its golden golden and i can still see it all in my head back and forth from new york sneakin in your bed i once believed love would be burnin red but its golden like daylight like daylight like daylight daylight i dont wanna look at anything else now that i saw you i can never look away and i dont wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you things will never be the same ive been sleepin so long in a twentyyear dark night now im wide awake and now i see daylight i see daylight i only see daylight ah i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight ah and i can still see it all i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight and i can still see it all back and forth from new york i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight i once believed love would be burning red like daylight its golden like daylight you gotta step into the daylight and let it go just let it go let it go i wanna be defined by the things that i love not the things i hate not the things im afraid of im afraid of or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night i i just think that you are what you love,love cruel cities lived everyone looked worse light many lines ive crossed unforgiven ill tell truth never goodbye dont wanna look anything else saw dont wanna think anything else thought ive sleepin long twentyyear dark night see daylight see daylight luck draw draws unlucky became butt joke wounded good trusted wicked clearin air breathed smoke maybe ran wolves refused settle maybe ive stormed every single room town threw cloaks daggers morning brighter dont wanna look anything else saw never look away dont wanna think anything else thought things never ive sleepin long twentyyear dark night im wide awake see daylight daylight see daylight daylight see daylight daylight daylight daylight see daylight daylight daylight daylight still see mind intertwined believed love would black white golden golden still see head back forth new york sneakin bed believed love would burnin red golden like daylight like daylight like daylight daylight dont wanna look anything else saw never look away dont wanna think anything else thought things never ive sleepin long twentyyear dark night im wide awake see daylight see daylight see daylight ah see daylight daylight daylight daylight see daylight daylight daylight daylight ah still see see daylight daylight daylight daylight still see back forth new york see daylight daylight daylight daylight believed love would burning red like daylight golden like daylight gotta step daylight let go let go let go wanna defined things love things hate things im afraid im afraid things haunt middle night think love,daylight
All Of The Girls You Loved Before,Lover,"When you think of all the late nights
Lame fights over the phone
Wake up in the mornin' with someone
But feelin' alone

[Refrain]
A heart is drawn around your name
In someone's handwriting, not mine
Sneakin' out into town
Holdin' hands, just killin' time

[Pre-Chorus]
Your past and mine are parallel lines
Stars all aligned and they intertwined
And taught you
The way you call me ""baby""
Treat me like a lady
All that I can say is

[Chorus]
All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

[Verse 2]
When I think of all the makeup
Fake love out on the town (Ooh)
Cryin' in the bathroom for some dude
Whose name I cannot remember now

[Refrain]
Secret jokes all alone
No one's home, sixteen and wild (Ooh)
Breakin' up, makin' up
Leave without sayin' goodbye (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
And just know that
It's everything that made me
Now I call you ""baby""
It's why you're so amazing

[Chorus]
All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more
[Bridge]
Your mother brought you up loyal and kind
Teenage love taught you there's good in goodbye
Every woman that you knew brought you here
I wanna teach you how forever feels

[Chorus]
Like the girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street (Dead-end street) led you straight to me (Straight to me)

the 1,folklore,"I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying ""yes"" instead of ""no""
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

[Verse 2]
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

[Bridge]
I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

[Chorus]
We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

Sensual politics

Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you

I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me

the last great american dynasty,folklore,"Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, ""How did a middle-class divorcée do it?""
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House""
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

[Chorus]
And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""

[Verse 2]
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí

[Chorus]
And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""

[Bridge]
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

[Chorus]
Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything

I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time

exile,folklore,"I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door
[Bridge: Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift & Both]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door
[Outro: Justin Vernon & Taylor Swift]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
You never gave a warning sign (All this time)
(So many times) I never learned to read your mind
(So many signs) I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)
You never gave a warning sign

my tears ricochet,folklore,"We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

[Verse 2]
We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

[Bridge]
And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)
And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet",we gather here we line up weepin in a sunlit room and if im on fire youll be made of ashes too even on my worst day did i deserve babe all the hell you gave me cause i loved you i swear i loved you til my dying day i didnt have it in myself to go with grace and youre the hero flying around saving face and if im dead to you why are you at the wake cursing my name wishing i stayed look at how my tears ricochet we gather stones never knowing what theyll mean some to throw some to make a diamond ring you know i didnt want to have to haunt you but what a ghostly scene you wear the same jewels that i gave you as you bury me i didnt have it in myself to go with grace cause when id fight you used to tell me i was brave and if im dead to you why are you at the wake cursing my name wishing i stayed look at how my tears ricochet and i can go anywhere i want anywhere i want just not home and you can aim for my heart go for blood but you would still miss me in your bones and i still talk to you when im screaming at the sky and when you cant sleep at night you hear my stolen lullabies i didnt have it in myself to go with grace and so the battleships will sink beneath the waves you had to kill me but it killed you just the same cursing my name wishing i stayed you turned into your worst fears and youre tossing out blame drunk on this pain crossing out the good years and youre cursing my name wishing i stayed look at how my tears ricochet,gather line weepin sunlit room im fire youll made ashes even worst day deserve babe hell gave cause loved swear loved til dying day didnt go grace youre hero flying around saving face im dead wake cursing name wishing stayed look tears ricochet gather stones never knowing theyll mean throw make diamond ring know didnt want haunt ghostly scene wear jewels gave bury didnt go grace cause id fight used tell brave im dead wake cursing name wishing stayed look tears ricochet go anywhere want anywhere want home aim heart go blood would still miss bones still talk im screaming sky cant sleep night hear stolen lullabies didnt go grace battleships sink beneath waves kill killed cursing name wishing stayed turned worst fears youre tossing blame drunk pain crossing good years youre cursing name wishing stayed look tears ricochet,tears ricochet

I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
I'll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break, it's in a million pieces

[Chorus]
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes

Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me

I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try

seven,folklore,"Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I, I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

[Bridge]
And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on

[Verse 2]
Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, won't tell no other

I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater

august,folklore,"Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of ""Are you sure?""
""Never have I ever before""

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Verse 2]
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Bridge]
Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""
So much for summer love and saying ""us""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Outro]
'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
""Meet me behind the mall""
(Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car"")
(And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?)
(Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

this is me trying,folklore,"I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
[Verse 2]
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Post-Chorus]
At least I'm trying

[Bridge]
And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town

[Chorus]
And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
(And maybe I don't quite know what to say)
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

illicit affairs,folklore,"Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You'll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times

[Verse 2]
Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don't even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times

[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times

[Bridge]
And you wanna scream
Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else

invisible string,folklore,"Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money

[Chorus]
Time, curious time
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer

[Chorus]
Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you

[Verse 3]
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey, but it brought me heaven
[Chorus]
Time, wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And it's cool, baby, with me
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

mad woman,folklore,"What did you think I'd say to that?
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
They strike to kill, and you know I will
You know I will
What do you sing on your drive home?
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
Does she smile?
Or does she mouth, ""Fuck you forever""?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

[Verse 2]
Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firin' at your yacht
They say, ""Move on,"" but you know I won't
And women like hunting witches too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
It's obvious that wanting me dead
Has really brought you two together

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

[Bridge]
I'm taking my time, taking my time
'Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb, watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad, should be scathing like me, but
No one likes a mad woman

Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out

Someone's daughter, someone's mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
""Doc, I think she's crashing out""

betty,folklore,"Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time, I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time, it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Verse 2]
Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time, it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Bridge]
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said, ""James, get in, let's drive""
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long
[Verse 3]
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

[Pre-Chorus]
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

[Chorus]
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Outro]
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight

peace,folklore,"Our coming-of-age has come and gone
Suddenly, this summer, it's clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And it's just around the corner, darlin'
'Cause it lives in me
No, I could never give you peace

[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

[Verse 2]
Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me

hoax,folklore,"My only one
My smoking gun
My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night
My winless fight
This has frozen my ground

[Chorus]
Stood on the cliffside screaming, ""Give me a reason""
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire

Stood on the cliffside screaming, ""Give me a reason""

Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

[Bridge]
You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
(Ah, ah, ah)
Darling, this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart

the lakes,folklore,"Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?
I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones

Take me to the Lakes, where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

[Verse 2]
What should be over, burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth

Take me to the Lakes, where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

[Bridge]
I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief

willow,evermore,"I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Bridge]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

[Verse 3]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

champagne problems,evermore,"You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

[Chorus]
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

[Verse 2]
You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

[Chorus]
Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

[Bridge]
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
""This dorm was once a madhouse""
I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

[Chorus]
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my

gold rush,evermore,"Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking
Ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in

[Chorus]
But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

[Verse 1]
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door

[Refrain]
At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we wandered 'round had never seen a love as pure as it
And then it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it could never be

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

[Verse 2]
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I can't dare to dream about you anymore

[Refrain]
At dinner parties, I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it will never be

'tis the damn season,evermore,"If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
While I was gone, I would've asked you
It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me

[Chorus]
So we could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

[Verse 2]
I parked my car right between the Methodist
And the school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run, but only so far
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me

[Chorus]
We could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

[Bridge]
Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
Who'll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving
And I'll be yours for the weekend
'Tis the damn season

[Chorus]
We could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

tolerate it,evermore,"I sit and watch you readin' with your head low
I wake and watch you breathin' with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser, and I

[Chorus]
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

[Verse 2]
I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listen
I polish plates until they gleam and glisten
You're so much older and wiser, and I

[Bridge]
While you were out buildin' other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm beggin' for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawin' hearts in the byline
Always takin' up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I (I)

[Chorus]
Break free and leave us in ruins?
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

"no body, no crime",evermore,"He did it
He did it

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Este's a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Este's been losin' sleep
Her husband's actin' different and it smells like infidelity
She says, ""That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
That ain't my jewelry on our joint account""
No, there ain't no doubt
I think I'm gonna call him out

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
She says, ""I think he did it, but I just can't prove it""
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die

[Post-Chorus: HAIM]
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive Garden
At her job or anywhere
He reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out 'cause

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die

[Post-Chorus: HAIM & Taylor Swift]
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Danielle Haim]
Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me (She was with me, dude)
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
She thinks I did it, but she just can't prove it

[Outro: Taylor Swift & HAIM]

happiness,evermore,"Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see this for what it is
But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given
Is just shit we're dividin' up
Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention
I haven't met the new me yet

[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would've loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

[Verse 2]
Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?
I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No, I didn't mean that
Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury
You haven't met the new me yet

[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things, I believe
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
And there is happiness

[Bridge]
I can't make it go away by making you a villain
I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too

[Verse 3]
Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You haven't met the new me yet
And I think she'll give you that
[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
Oh, leave it all behind
Leave it all behind

A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
And I got nothin' but well wishes for ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
This place is the same as it ever was
Ooh
But you won't like it that way

You know that you'll always know me

You're a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' makeup and magazines
Ooh
From you, I'd buy anything

Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When it was calmer, skippin' the prom
Just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers? Well

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
I guess I'll never know
Ooh
And you'll go on with the show

coney island,evermore,"Break my soul in two looking for you
But you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering, where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Verse 2: Matt Berninger with Taylor Swift]
The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge
But you were too polite to leave me?
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Matt Berninger]
'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Matt Berninger, Both]
Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line by the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day?
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake, happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
A universe away
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium
I think that I forgot to say your name

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]
I'm on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering, where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

ivy,evermore,"How's one to know?
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faith-forgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand

[Pre-Chorus]
And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I don't, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living

[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you

[Verse 2]
I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed
He's in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants what's only yours

[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered

[Verse 3]
Clover blooms in the fields
Spring breaks loose, the time is near
What would he do if he found us out?
Crescent moon, coast is clear
Spring breaks loose, but so does fear
He's gonna burn this house to the ground
How's one to know?
I'd live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
And drink my husband's wine

[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you
And I'm covered in you
[Bridge]
So yeah, it's a fire
It's a goddamn blaze in the dark
And you started it
You started it
So yeah, it's a war
It's the goddamn fight of my life
And you started it
You started it

[Chorus]

cowboy like me,evermore,"And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent-like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said, ""Dancin' is a dangerous game""
Oh, I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
I'm never gonna love again

[Refrain]
I've got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one

Perched in the dark
Tellin' all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life, never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to fuck this up
And the old men that I've swindled
Really did believe I was the one
And the ladies lunchin' have their stories about

Oh, but that was all before I locked it down

With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con

long story short,evermore,"Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break

[Chorus]
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy

[Verse 2]
Actually
I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready

[Chorus]
'Cause I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time

No more tug of war
Now I just know there's more (Know there's more)
No more keepin' score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
And my waves meet your shore
Ever and evermore

[Verse 3]
Past me
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
Your nemeses
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
And he's passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go
[Chorus]
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff

Long limbs and frozen swims

The car ride back and up the stairs

I should've asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Should've kept every grocery store receipt
'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me

evermore,evermore,"Gray November
I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I was catchin' my breath
Starin' out an open window, catchin' my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Hey, December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind the tape, but all it does is pause
On the very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I was catchin' my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter, catchin' my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

[Post-Chorus: Justin Vernon]
(Evermore)
[Bridge: Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift]
Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain we'll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?
And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost now)
I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)
I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again)
(If you think of all the cost)
It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)
(Or the violence of the dog days)
(Out on waves, being tossed)
(I'm on waves, out being tossed)
But I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?)
You were there
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
And I was catchin' my breath
Floors of a cabin creakin' under my step
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar

Pages turn and stick to each other

[Pre-Chorus]
Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, ""What a sad sight,"" I
I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective, but I sat and stared right where

You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no

Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?
Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy

She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
And you're sitting in front of me

When I was still the one you want
Cross-legged in the dim light

Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware 'cause I'm right where

it's time to go,evermore,"When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
You ask for the tab
Or that moment again, he's insisting that friends
Look at each other like that
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not
In fact what she seemed, not a twin from your dreams
She's a crook who was caught

[Chorus]
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go

[Verse 2]
Twenty years at your job, then the son of the boss
Gets the spot that was yours
Or trying to stay for the kids, when keeping it how it is
Will only break their hearts worse

[Chorus]
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes, givin' up is the strong thing
Sometimes, to run is the brave thing
Sometimes, walkin' out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes, givin' up is the strong thing
Sometimes, to run is the brave thing
Sometimes, walkin' out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing

[Verse 3]
Fifteen years, fifteen million tears
Begging 'til my knees bled
I gave it my all, he gave me nothin' at all
Then wondered why I left
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
Praying to his greed
He's got my past frozen behind glass
But I've got me

[Chorus]
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in my soul
I know when it's time to go

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes, givin' up is the strong thing
Sometimes, to run is the brave thing
Sometimes, walkin' out is the one thing

Sometimes, givin' up is the strong thing
Sometimes, to run is the brave thing
Sometimes, walkin' out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing

That will find you the right thing
And you know in your soul
And you know in your soul
When it's time to go
And, well, you know, you know, you know, you know

Maroon,Midnights,"When the morning came
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
'Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
""How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?"" you say
""Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how""
I see you every day now

[Chorus]
And I chose you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

[Verse 2]
When the silence came
We were shaking, blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends?
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
I feel you, no matter what
The rubies that I gave up

[Chorus]
And I lost you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was (Maroon)
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was (Maroon)
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

[Bridge]
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy, legacy (It was maroon)
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy to leave

[Chorus]
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was maroon
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon
[Outro]
It was maroon

Anti-Hero,Midnights,"I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Bridge]
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""

[Breakdown]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees
[Chorus]
It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

Snow On The Beach,Midnights,"One night, a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey]
And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Lana Del Rey]
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey]
This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched ""aurora borealis green""
I've never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it
'Til you do, 'til it's true

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey]
Now it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey]
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah
[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey]
I (I) can't (Can't) speak, afraid to jinx it
I (I) don't (Don't) even dare to wish it
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
Now I'm all for you like Janet
Can this be a real thing? Can it?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey, Taylor Swift]
Are we falling like snow at the beach? (Snow at the beach)
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream (Flying in a dream)
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me (You wanting me)
Tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Lana Del Rey]
Like snow on the beach (Snow on the beach)
Like snow on the beach (Flying in a dream)
Like snow on the beach (You wanting me)
Like snow, ah
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around

[Outro: Taylor Swift]
Like snow on the beach
(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)
(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)
Like snow on the beach
(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)

"You're On Your Own, Kid",Midnights,"Summer went away, still, the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me
It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days

[Pre-Chorus]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared

[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

[Verse 2]
I see the great escape, so long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed, writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away

[Pre-Chorus]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare

[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
My friends from home don't know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid
[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
You're on your own, kid
You always have been",summer went away still the yearning stays i play it cool with the best of them i wait patiently hes gonna notice me its okay were the best of friends anyway i hear it in your voice youre smoking with your boys i touch my phone as if its your face i didnt choose this town i dream of getting out theres just one who could make me stay all my days from sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes i waited ages to see you there i search the party of better bodies just to learn that you never cared youre on your own kid you always have been i see the great escape so long daisy may i picked the petals he loves me not something different bloomed writing in my room i play my songs in the parking lot ill run away from sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes i called a taxi to take me there i search the party of better bodies just to learn that my dreams arent rare youre on your own kid you always have been from sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes i gave my blood sweat and tears for this i hosted parties and starved my body like id be saved by a perfect kiss the jokes werent funny i took the money my friends from home dont know what to say i looked around in a bloodsoaked gown and i saw something they cant take away cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned everything you lose is a step you take so make the friendship bracelets take the moment and taste it youve got no reason to be afraid youre on your own kid yeah you can face this youre on your own kid you always have been,summer went away still yearning stays play cool best wait patiently hes gonna notice okay best friends anyway hear voice youre smoking boys touch phone face didnt choose town dream getting theres one could make stay days sprinkler splashes fireplace ashes waited ages see search party better bodies learn never cared youre kid always see great escape long daisy may picked petals loves something different bloomed writing room play songs parking lot ill run away sprinkler splashes fireplace ashes called taxi take search party better bodies learn dreams arent rare youre kid always sprinkler splashes fireplace ashes gave blood sweat tears hosted parties starved body like id saved perfect kiss jokes werent funny took money friends home dont know say looked around bloodsoaked gown saw something cant take away cause pages turned bridges burned everything lose step take make friendship bracelets take moment taste youve got reason afraid youre kid yeah face youre kid always,"own, kid"
Midnight Rain,Midnights,"Rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

[Verse 1]
My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain

[Chorus]
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

[Verse 2]
It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him, it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away
'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain

[Chorus]
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

[Outro]
I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
And he never thinks of me
Except for when I'm on TV
I guess sometimes we all get
Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this
(Midnights like this, midnights like this)",rain he wanted it comfortable i wanted that pain he wanted a bride i was making my own name chasing that fame he stayed the same all of me changed like midnight my town was a wasteland full of cages full of fences pageant queens and big pretenders but for some it was paradise my boy was a montage a slowmotion love potion jumping off things in the ocean i broke his heart cause he was nice he was sunshine i was midnight rain he wanted it comfortable i wanted that pain he wanted a bride i was making my own name chasing that fame he stayed the same all of me changed like midnight it came like a postcard picture perfect shiny family holiday peppermint candy but for him its every day so i peered through a window a deep portal time travel all the love we unravel and the life i gave away cause he was sunshine i was midnight rain he wanted it comfortable i wanted that pain he wanted a bride i was making my own name chasing that fame he stayed the same all of me changed like midnight rain he wanted it comfortable i wanted that pain he wanted a bride i was making my own name chasing that fame he stayed the same all of me changed like midnight i guess sometimes we all get just what we wanted just what we wanted and he never thinks of me except for when im on tv i guess sometimes we all get some kind of haunted some kind of haunted and i never think of him except on midnights like this midnights like this midnights like this,rain wanted comfortable wanted pain wanted bride making name chasing fame stayed changed like midnight town wasteland full cages full fences pageant queens big pretenders paradise boy montage slowmotion love potion jumping things ocean broke heart cause nice sunshine midnight rain wanted comfortable wanted pain wanted bride making name chasing fame stayed changed like midnight came like postcard picture perfect shiny family holiday peppermint candy every day peered window deep portal time travel love unravel life gave away cause sunshine midnight rain wanted comfortable wanted pain wanted bride making name chasing fame stayed changed like midnight rain wanted comfortable wanted pain wanted bride making name chasing fame stayed changed like midnight guess sometimes get wanted wanted never thinks except im tv guess sometimes get kind haunted kind haunted never think except midnights like midnights like midnights like,midnight rain
Question...?,Midnights,"I remember

[Verse 1]
Good girl, sad boy
Big city, wrong choices
We had one thing goin' on
I swear that it was somethin'
'Cause I don't remember who I was
Before you painted all my nights
A color I've searched for since
But one thing after another
Fuckin' situations, circumstances
Miscommunications, and I
Have to say, by the way
I just may like some explanations

[Chorus]
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question

[Verse 2]
Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
Did you realize out of time?
She was on your mind with some dickhead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on somethin'
It was one drink after another
Fuckin' politics and gender roles
And you're not sure and I don't know
Got swept away in the gray
I just may like to have a conversation

[Chorus]
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question

[Bridge]
Does it feel like everything's just like
Second best after that meteor strike?
And what's that that I heard? That you're still with her?
That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable
And right, but tonight
[Chorus]
Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?)
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room (In a crowded room)
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you (Makin' fun of you)
But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?
Then what did you do? (Do)
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh (More of a fight)

Vigilante Shit,Midnights,"Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them
Sometimes I wonder which one'll be your last lie
They say looks can kill and I might try
I don't dress for women
I don't dress for men
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge

[Chorus]
I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge

[Verse 2]
She needed cold, hard proof, so I gave her some
She had the envelope, where you think she got it from?
Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride
Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife
And she looks so pretty
Drivin' in your Benz
Lately, she's been dressin' for revenge

[Chorus]
She don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
She don't dress for friends
Lately, she's been dressing for revenge

[Bridge]
Ladies always rise above
Ladies know what people want
Someone sweet and kind and fun
The lady simply had enough

[Verse 3]
While he was doin' lines and crossin' all of mine
Someone told his white-collar crimes to the FBI
And I don't dress for villains
Or for innocents
I'm on my vigilante shit again

[Chorus]
I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even

Bejeweled,Midnights,"Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight

[Chorus]
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I could still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice

[Post-Chorus]
Nice

[Verse 2]
Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (Too good of a girl)
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world (Huh), have you heard? (Huh)
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you (Miss you), but I miss sparklin' (Nice)

[Chorus]
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room

Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice

[Post-Chorus]
Nice

[Bridge]
Sapphire tears on my face
Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my aura's moonstone
Just 'cause he was high
And we're dancin' all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do?
A diamond's gotta shine
[Chorus]
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer (Shimmer)
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I could still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real (Nice), I polish up real nice

[Outro]
And we're dancin' all night
And you can try to change my mind

Was what I was thinkin' the whole time
Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out
I'll be gettin' over you my whole life

[Pre-Chorus]
You know how scared I am of elevators
Never trust it if it rises fast
It can't last

[Chorus]
Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
Oh, I'm fallin' in love
I thought the plane was goin' down
How'd you turn it right around?

[Verse 2]
It only feels this raw right now
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
Break up, break free, break through, break down
You would break your back to make me break a smile

[Pre-Chorus]
You know how much I hate
That everybody just expects me to bounce back
Just like that

[Chorus]
Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
Oh, I'm fallin' in love

Karma,Midnights,"You're talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around

[Pre-Chorus]
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

[Chorus]
'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

[Verse 2]
Spiderboy, king of thieves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?
It's coming back around

[Pre-Chorus]
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

[Chorus]
'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

[Bridge]
Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here
(I'm still here, I'm still here)

[Breakdown]
'Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karma's gonna track you down
Step by step, from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me
[Chorus]
'Cause karma is my boyfriend (Karma is my boyfriend)
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (Weekend)
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Sweet Nothing,Midnights,"I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
They said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'

[Verse 2]
On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, ""What a mind""
This happens all the time
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
'Cause they said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was nothin'

[Bridge]
Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore, ""You should be doing more""
To you, I can admit that I'm just too soft for all of it
Ooh

[Chorus]
They said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings

Mastermind,Midnights,"Once upon a time, the planets and the fates
And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time

[Pre-Chorus]
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose

[Chorus]
What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all by design
'Cause I'm a mastermind

[Verse 2]
You see, all the wisest women
Had to do it this way
'Cause we were born to be the pawn
In every lover's game

[Pre-Chorus]
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails

[Chorus]
What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
I knew I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all my design
'Cause I'm a mastermind
[Bridge]
No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me and make it seem effortless
This is the first time I've felt the need to confess
And I swear
I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian
'Cause I care
[Chorus]
So I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Saw a wide smirk on your face
You knew the entire time
You knew that I'm a mastermind
And now you're mine
Yeah, all you did was smile

Hits Different,Midnights,"I washed my hands of us at the club
You made a mess of me
I pictured you with other girls in love
Then threw up on the street
Like waiting for a bus that never shows
You just start walkin' on
They say that if it's right, you know
Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong

[Chorus]
Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different 'cause it's you

[Post-Chorus]
('Cause it's you)

[Verse 2]
I used to switch out these Kens, I'd just ghost
Rip the band-aid off and skip town like an asshole outlaw
Freedom felt like summer then on the coast
Now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings
And I never don't cry (And I never don't cry) at the bar
Yeah, my sadness is contagious (My sadness is contagious)
I slur your name 'til someone puts me in a car
I stopped receiving invitations

[Chorus]
Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different 'cause it's you

[Post-Chorus]
('Cause it's you)

[Bridge]
I find the artifacts, cried over a hat
Cursed the space that I needed
I trace the evidence, make it make some sense
Why the wound is still bleedin'
You were the one that I loved
Don't need another metaphor, it's simple enough
A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes
This is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy
Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief
In the good in the world, you once believed in me
And I felt you and I held you for a while
Bet I could still melt your world
Argumentative, antithetical dream girl
[Verse 3]
I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway
Is that your key in the door?
Is it okay? Is it you?
Or have they come to take me away?
To take me away

[Chorus]
Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different (It hits different)
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different (It hits different)
It hits different 'cause it's you

[Outro]
Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
'Cause it's you
Catastrophic blues

The Great War,Midnights,"My knuckles were bruised like violets
Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down, took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur

[Chorus]
All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, tears on the letter
I vowed not to cry anymore
If we survived the Great War

[Verse 2]
You drew up some good faith treaties
I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone
You said I have to trust more freely
But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire
And maybe it's the past that's talking
Screaming from the crypt
Telling me to punish you for things you never did
So I justified it

[Chorus]
All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the bombs were closer
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, the burning embers
I vowed not to fight anymore
If we survived the Great War

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh, uh-huh

[Bridge]
It turned into something bigger
Somewhere in the haze, got a sense I'd been betrayed
Your finger on my hairpin triggers
Soldier down on that icy ground
Looked up at me with honor and truth
Broken and blue, so I called off the troops
That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought I'd lost you

[Verse 3]
We can plant a memory garden
Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair
There's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair
And we will never go back
[Chorus]
To that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the worst was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, we're burned for better
I vowed I would always be yours
'Cause we survived the Great War

[Outro]
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I will always be yours
'Cause we survived the Great War
Uh-huh
I vow I will always be yours",my knuckles were bruised like violets sucker punching walls cursed you as i sleeptalked spineless in my tomb of silence tore your banners down took the battle underground and maybe it was egos swinging maybe it was her flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur all that bloodshed crimson clover uhhuh sweet dream was over my hand was the one you reached for all throughout the great war always remember uhhuh tears on the letter i vowed not to cry anymore if we survived the great war you drew up some good faith treaties i drew curtains closed drank my poison all alone you said i have to trust more freely but diesel is desire you were playing with fire and maybe its the past thats talking screaming from the crypt telling me to punish you for things you never did so i justified it all that bloodshed crimson clover uhhuh the bombs were closer my hand was the one you reached for all throughout the great war always remember uhhuh the burning embers i vowed not to fight anymore if we survived the great war uhhuh uhhuh it turned into something bigger somewhere in the haze got a sense id been betrayed your finger on my hairpin triggers soldier down on that icy ground looked up at me with honor and truth broken and blue so i called off the troops that was the night i nearly lost you i really thought id lost you we can plant a memory garden say a solemn prayer place a poppy in my hair theres no morning glory it was war it wasnt fair and we will never go back to that bloodshed crimson clover uhhuh the worst was over my hand was the one you reached for all throughout the great war always remember uhhuh were burned for better i vowed i would always be yours cause we survived the great war uhhuh uhhuh i will always be yours cause we survived the great war uhhuh i vow i will always be yours,knuckles bruised like violets sucker punching walls cursed sleeptalked spineless tomb silence tore banners took battle underground maybe egos swinging maybe flashes battle come back blur bloodshed crimson clover uhhuh sweet dream hand one reached throughout great war always remember uhhuh tears letter vowed cry anymore survived great war drew good faith treaties drew curtains closed drank poison alone said trust freely diesel desire playing fire maybe past thats talking screaming crypt telling punish things never justified bloodshed crimson clover uhhuh bombs closer hand one reached throughout great war always remember uhhuh burning embers vowed fight anymore survived great war uhhuh uhhuh turned something bigger somewhere haze got sense id betrayed finger hairpin triggers soldier icy ground looked honor truth broken blue called troops night nearly lost really thought id lost plant memory garden say solemn prayer place poppy hair theres morning glory war wasnt fair never go back bloodshed crimson clover uhhuh worst hand one reached throughout great war always remember uhhuh burned better vowed would always cause survived great war uhhuh uhhuh always cause survived great war uhhuh vow always,great war
Bigger Than The Whole Sky,Midnights,"No words appear before me in the aftermath
Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears
Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness
'Cause it's all over now, all out to sea

[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you
What could've been, would've been you

[Verse 2]
Did some bird flap its wings over in Asia?
Did some force take you because I didn't pray?
Every single thing to come has turned into ashes
'Cause it's all over, it's not meant to be
So I'll say words I don't believe

[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you

What could've been, would've been you
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Rain soaking, blind hoping
You said I was freeloading
I didn't know you were keeping count

[Chorus]
High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it
High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives

Do you really wanna know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?

Bad omen
Dragged my feet right down the aisle
At the house lonely, good money
I'd pay if you'd just know me
Seemed like the right thing at the time

You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough

Do I really have to tell you how he brought me back to life?

"Would've, Could've, Should've",Midnights,"If you would've blinked, then I would've
Looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison, you could've
Spit me out at the first chance
And if I was some paint, did it splatter
On a promising grown man?
And if I was a child, did it matter
If you got to wash your hands?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, all I used to do was pray
Would've, could've, should've
If you'd never looked my way

[Chorus]
I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering

[Verse 2]
If you never touched me, I would've
Gone along with the righteous
If I never blushed, then they could've
Never whispered about this
And if you never saved me from boredom
I could've gone on as I was
But, Lord, you made me feel important
And then you tried to erase us

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you're a crisis of my faith
Would've, could've, should've
If I'd only played it safe

[Chorus]
I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering

[Bridge]
God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time
[Verse 3]
If clarity's in death, then why won't this die?
Years of tearing down our banners, you and I
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts
Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first

[Chorus]
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering

If you knew where I was walking
To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there
Where I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care
No one sees when you lose when you're playing solitaire

You're Losing Me (From The Vault),Midnights,"You say, ""I don't understand,"" and I say, ""I know you don't""
We thought a cure would come through in time, now, I fear it won't
Remember lookin' at this room? We loved it 'cause of the light
Now, I just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time

[Pre-Chorus]
Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?
I'm getting tired even for a phoenix
Always risin' from the ashes
Mendin' all her gashes
You might just have dealt the final blow

[Chorus]
Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore for you
'Cause you're losin' me

[Verse 2]
Every mornin', I glared at you with storms in my eyes
How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dyin'?
I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick
My face was gray, but you wouldn't admit that we were sick

[Pre-Chorus]
And the air is thick with loss and indecision
I know my pain is such an imposition
Now, you're runnin' down the hallway
And you know what they all say
""You don't know what you got until it's gone""

[Chorus]
Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore for you
'Cause you're losin' me
'Cause you're losin' me
Stop (Stop) 'cause you're losin' me

My heart won't start anymore

(Stop 'cause you're losin' me)

[Bridge]
How long could we be a sad song
'Til we were too far gone to bring back to life?
I gave you all my best me's, my endless empathy
And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier
Fighting in only your army, frontlines, don't you ignore me
I'm the best thing at this party (You're losin' me)
And I wouldn't marry me either
A pathological people pleaser
Who only wanted you to see her
And I'm fadin', thinkin'
""Do something, babe, say something"" (Say something)
""Lose something, babe, risk something"" (You're losin' me)
""Choose something, babe, I got nothing"" (I got nothing)

Karma (Remix),Midnights,"Karma is that girl, like (Grrah)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
You're talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's comin' back around

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me

Fortnight,The Tortured Poets Department,"I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say I hope you're okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone, Post Malone]
All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February
I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary
And I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, but I touched you

And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him

The Tortured Poets Department,The Tortured Poets Department,"You left your typewriter at my apartment
Straight from the tortured poets department
I think some things I never say
Like, ""Who uses typewriters anyway?""
But you're in self-sabotage mode
Throwing spikes down on the road
But I've seen this episode and still loved the show
Who else decodes you?

[Chorus]
And who's gonna hold you like me?
And who's gonna know you, if not me?
I laughed in your face and said
""You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're modern idiots""
And who's gonna hold you like me?

[Post-Chorus]
Nobody
No-fucking-body
Nobody

[Verse 2]
You smoked, then ate seven bars of chocolate
We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist
I scratch your head, you fall asleep
Like a tattooed golden retriever
But you awaken with dread
Pounding nails in your head
But I've read this one where you come undone
I chose this cyclone with you

Sometimes, I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me
But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave
And I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen
Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be
'Cause we're crazy
So tell me, who else is gonna know me?
At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger
And put it on the one people put wedding rings on
And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding
[Chorus]
Who's gonna hold you? (Who?)
Me
Who's gonna know you? (Who?)
Me
And you're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith

My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys,The Tortured Poets Department,"Oh, here we go again
The voices in his head
Called the rain to end our days of wild
The sickest army doll
Purchased at the mall
Rivulets descend my plastic smile

[Pre-Chorus]
But you should've seen him when he first got me

[Chorus]
My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
I'm queen of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh
'Cause it fit too right, puzzle pieces in the dead of night
I should've known it was a matter of time, oh, oh
My boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
There was a litany of reasons why
We could've played for keeps this time
I know I'm just repeating myself
Put me back on my shelf
But first, pull the string
And I'll tell you that he runs
Because he loves me (He loves me)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you should've seen him when he first saw me

[Chorus]
My boy (My boy), only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
I'm queen (I'm queen), of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh
'Cause I knew too much, there was danger in the heat of my touch
He saw forever, so he smashed it up, oh, oh
My boy (My boy), only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Once I fix me
He's gonna miss me
Once I fix me
He's gonna miss me

[Outro]
Just say when, I'd play again
He was my best friend down at the sandlot
I felt more when we played pretend
Than with all the Kens
'Cause he took me out of my box
Stole my tortured heart

Down Bad,The Tortured Poets Department,"Did you really beam me up
In a cloud of sparkling dust
Just to do experiments on?
Tell me I was the chosen one
Showed me that this world is bigger than us
Then sent me back where I came from

[Pre-Chorus]
For a moment, I knew cosmic love

[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him""
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad

Down bad

[Verse 2]
Did you take all my old clothes
Just to leave me here, naked and alone
In a field in my same old town
That somehow seems so hollow now?
They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about
The existence of you

[Pre-Chorus]
For a moment, I was heavenstruck

Encounters closer and closer
All your indecent exposures
How dare you say that it's - 
I'll build you a fort on some planet
Where they can all understand it
How dare you think it's romantic
Leaving me safe and stranded
'Cause fuck it, I was in love
So fuck you if I can't have us
'Cause fuck it, I was in love

[Verse 1]
I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist
I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift
Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away
My spine split from carrying us up the hill
Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill
I stopped tryna make him laugh, stopped tryna drill the safe

[Chorus]
Thinkin', ""How much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?""
Oh, the tragedy
So long, London
You'll find someone

[Verse 2]
I didn't opt in to be your odd man out
I founded the club she's heard great things about
I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath
I stopped CPR, after all, it's no use
The spirit was gone, we would never come to
And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free

[Chorus]
For so long, London
Stitches undone
Two graves, one gun
I'll find someone

[Bridge]
And you say I abandoned the ship
But I was going down with it
My white-knuckle dying grip
Holding tight to your quiet resentment
And my friends said it isn't right to be scared
Every day of a love affair
Every breath feels like rarest air
When you're not sure if he wants to be there

[Chorus]
So how much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?
How much tragedy?
Just how low did you
Think I'd go 'fore I'd self-implode?
'Fore I'd have to go be free?

[Verse 3]
You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?
I died on the altar waitin' for the proof
You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days
And I'm just getting color back into my face
I'm just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place for

But Daddy I Love Him,The Tortured Poets Department,"I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun
I just learned these people only raise you
To cage you
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, ""What a mess""
I just learned these people try and save you
'Cause they hate you

[Pre-Chorus]
Too high a horse
For a simple girl
To rise above it
They slammed the door
On my whole world
The one thing I wanted

[Chorus]
Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Screamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through the fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

[Verse 2]
Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid
Tendrils tucked into a woven braid
Growin' up precocious sometimes means
Not growin' up at all
He was chaos, he was revelry
Bedroom eyes like a remedy
Soon enough, the elders had convened
Down at the city hall

[Pre-Chorus]
""Stay away from her""
The saboteurs
Protested too much
Lord knows the words
We never heard
Just screeching tires and true love

[Chorus]
And I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Screamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through the fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want
[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you something right now
I'd rather burn my whole life down
Than listen to one more second of all this bitchin' and moanin'
I'll tell you something 'bout my good name
It's mine alone to disgrace
I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing

[Bridge]
God save the most judgmental creeps
Who say they want what's best for me
Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
Thinkin' it can change the beat
Of my heart when he touches me
And counteract the chemistry
And undo the destiny
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's just my choice

[Verse 3]
There's a lot of people in town that I
Bestow upon my fakest smiles
Scandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer
We came back when the heat died down
Went to my parents and they came around
All the wine moms are still holdin' out, but fuck 'em, it's over
[Chorus]
Now I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun and
Even my daddy just loves him
I'm his lady
And, oh my God, you should see your faces
Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
And, no, you can't come to the wedding
I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want

[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you something right now
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice

[Outro]
Screamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm having his baby
No, I'm not
But you should see your faces
But, oh my God, you should see your faces

Fresh Out The Slammer,The Tortured Poets Department,"Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
Fresh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
(Fresh out the slammer, oh)

[Verse 1]
Another summer takin' cover, rolling thunder
He don't understand me
Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter
He was with her in dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Gray and blue and fights and tunnels
Handcuffed to the spell I was under
For just one hour of sunshine
Years of labor, locks, and ceilings
In the shade of how he was feeling
But it's gonna be alright, I did my time

[Chorus]
Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
Fresh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
(Fresh out the slammer, oh)

[Verse 2]
Camera flashes, welcome bashes, get the matches
Toss the ashes off the ledge
As I said in my letters, now that I know better
I will never lose my baby again

[Pre-Chorus]
My friends tried, but I wouldn't hear it
Watch me daily disappearing
For just one glimpse of his smile
All those nights, he kept me goin'
Swirled you into all of my poems
Now we're at the starting line, I did my time

[Chorus]
Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin'

[Bridge]
To the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams (Gleams)
To the one who says I'm the girl of his American dreams
And no matter what I've done, it wouldn't matter anyway
Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up now that I know what's at stake here
At the park where we used to sit on children's swings
Wearing imaginary rings

[Outro]

Florida!!!,The Tortured Poets Department,"You can beat the heat if you beat the charges too
They said I was a cheat, I guess it must be true
And my friends all smell like weed or little babies
And this city reeks of driving myself crazy

Little did you know your home's really only
A town you're just a guest in
So you work your life away just to pay
For a time-share down in Destin

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Florence Welch, Taylor Swift]
Florida

Florida
Can I use you up?

[Verse 2: Florence Welch, Taylor Swift & Florence Welch]
The hurricane with my name when it came
I got drunk and I dared it to wash me away
Barricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine
Well, me and my ghosts, we had a hell of a time
Yes, I'm haunted, but I'm feeling just fine
All my girls got their lace and their crimes
And your cheating husband disappeared, well
No one asks any questions here
So I did my best to lay to rest
All of the bodies that have ever been on my body
And in my mind, they sink into the swamp
Is that a bad thing to say in a song?

[Pre-Chorus: Florence Welch]

Guilty as Sin?,The Tortured Poets Department,"Drownin' in the Blue Nile
He sent me ""Downtown Lights""
I hadn't heard it in a while
My boredom's bone-deep
This cage was once just fine
Am I allowed to cry?
I dream of crackin' locks
Throwin' my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks
Crashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox
I'm seeing visions
Am I bad or mad or wise?

[Chorus]
What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

[Verse 2]
I keep these longings locked
In lowercase, inside a vault
Someone told me, ""There's no such thing as bad thoughts
Only your actions talk""
These fatal fantasies
Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me
We've already done it in my head
If it's make-believe
Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?

[Chorus]
What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
My bed sheets are ablaze
I've screamed his name
Buildin' up like waves crashin' over my grave
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

[Bridge]
What if I roll the stone away?
They're gonna crucify me anyway
What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?
If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me
They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly
I choose you and me religiously

[Chorus]
What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?,The Tortured Poets Department,"The who's who of ""Who's that?"" is poised for the attack
But my bare hands paved their paths
You don't get to tell me about ""sad""

[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanted me dead, you should've just said
Nothing makes me feel more alive

[Chorus]
So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
""Who's afraid of little old me?""
You should be

[Verse 2]
The scandal was contained
The bullet had just grazed
At all costs, keep your good name
You don't get to tell me you feel bad

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it a wonder I broke? Let's hear one more joke
Then we could all just laugh until I cry

[Chorus]
So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
""Who's afraid of little old me?""
I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean
""Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth""
Who's afraid of little old me?
Well, you should be

[Post-Chorus]
(You should be) You should be
(You should be) You should be
You should be (You should be)
You should be (You should be)
You should be

[Bridge]
So tell me everything is not about me
But what if it is?
Then say they didn't do it to hurt me
But what if they did?
I wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me
You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me
So all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs
I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?
That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn
That I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong
Put narcotics into all of my songs
And that's why you're still singin' along

[Chorus]
So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
""Who's afraid of little old me?""
I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean
""Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth""
Who's afraid of little old me?
Well, you should be
[Post-Chorus]
(You should be) You should be
(You should be) You should be
'Cause you lured me (You should be)
And you hurt me (You should be)
And you taught me

I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can),The Tortured Poets Department,"The smoke cloud billows out his mouth
Like a freight train through a small town
The jokes that he told across the bar
Were revolting and far too loud

They shake their heads sayin', ""God, help her""
When I tell 'em he's my man
But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger
I can fix him, no, really, I can
And only I can

[Verse 2]
The dopamine races through his brain
On a six-lane Texas highway
His hand so calloused from his pistol
Softly traces hearts on my face
And I could see it from a mile away
A perfect case for my certain skill set
He had a halo of the highest grade
He just hadn't met me yet

[Chorus]
They shake their heads sayin', ""God, help her""
When I tell 'em he's my man
But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger
I can fix him, no, really, I can

Good boy, that's right, come close
I'll show you Heaven if you'll be an angel, all night

No, really, I can

loml,The Tortured Poets Department,"Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames
If we know the steps anyway?
We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
Stitching, ""We were just kids, babe""
I said, ""I don't mind, it takes time""
I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
I felt aglow like this
Never before and never since

[Chorus]
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
You and I go from one kiss to getting married
Still alive, killing time at the cemetery
Never quite buried
In your suit and tie, in the nick of time
You low-down boy, you stand-up guy
You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life
You said I'm the love of your life
About a million times

[Verse 2]
Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
And told me I reformed you?
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
Well, you took me to hell too
And all at once, the ink bleeds
A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme
But I've felt a hole like this
Never before and ever since

[Chorus]
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
What we thought was for all time was momentary
Still alive, killing time at the cemetery
Never quite buried
You cinephile in black and white
All those plot twists and dynamite
Mr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry
You said I'm the love of your life

[Bridge]
You shit-talked me under the table
Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles
I wish I could un-recall
How we almost had it all
Dancing phantoms on the terrace
Are they second-hand embarrassed
That I can't get out of bed
'Cause something counterfeit's dead?
It was legendary
It was momentary
It was unnecessary
Should've let it stay buried

[Chorus]
Oh, what a valiant roar
What a bland goodbye
The coward claimed he was a lion
I'm combing through the braids of lies
""I'll never leave,"" ""Never mind""
Our field of dreams engulfed in fire

I Can Do It With A Broken Heart,The Tortured Poets Department,"I can read your mind
""She's having the time of her life""
There in her glittering prime
The lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night
I can show you lies
(One, two, three, four)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle my shit
They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"" and I did
Lights, camera, bitch, smile
Even when you wanna die
He said he'd love me all his life
But that life was too short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, ""More""
I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
I was hittin' my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
(One, two, three, four)
[Chorus]
I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart

[Verse 2]
I can hold my breath
I've been doin' it since he left
I keep finding his things in drawers
Crucial evidence I didn't imagine the whole thing
I'm sure I can pass this test
(One, two, three, four)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle my shit
They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"" and I did
Lights, camera, bitch, smile
In stilettos for miles
He said he'd love me for all time
But that time was quite short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, ""More""
I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
I was hittin' my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
(One, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me (He avoids me), like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart

You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
You know you're good

The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived,The Tortured Poets Department,"Was any of it true?
Gazing at me starry-eyed
In your Jehovah's Witness suit
Who the fuck was that guy?
You tried to buy some pills
From a friend of friends of mine
They just ghosted you
Now you know what it feels like

[Chorus]
And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?

[Verse 2]
You hung me on your wall
Stabbed me with your push pins
In public, showed me off
Then sank in stoned oblivion
'Cause once your queen had come
You'd treat her like an also-ran
You didn't measure up
In any measure of a man

[Chorus]
And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?

[Bridge]
Were you sent by someone who wanted me dead?
Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?
Were you writin' a book? Were you a sleeper cell spy?
In fifty years, will all this be declassified?
And you'll confess why you did it and I'll say, ""Good riddance""
'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden
I would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside
And you deserve prison, but you won't get time
You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars
You crashed my party and your rental car
You said normal girls were boring
But you were gone by the morning
You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing

[Outro]
And in plain sight you hid
But you are what you did
And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive
The smallest man who ever lived",was any of it true gazing at me starryeyed in your jehovahs witness suit who the fuck was that guy you tried to buy some pills from a friend of friends of mine they just ghosted you now you know what it feels like and i dont even want you back i just want to know if rusting my sparkling summer was the goal and i dont miss what we had but could someone give a message to the smallest man who ever lived you hung me on your wall stabbed me with your push pins in public showed me off then sank in stoned oblivion cause once your queen had come youd treat her like an alsoran you didnt measure up in any measure of a man and i dont even want you back i just want to know if rusting my sparkling summer was the goal and i dont miss what we had but could someone give a message to the smallest man who ever lived were you sent by someone who wanted me dead did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed were you writin a book were you a sleeper cell spy in fifty years will all this be declassified and youll confess why you did it and ill say good riddance cause it wasnt sexy once it wasnt forbidden i wouldve died for your sins instead i just died inside and you deserve prison but you wont get time youll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars you crashed my party and your rental car you said normal girls were boring but you were gone by the morning you kicked out the stage lights but youre still performing and in plain sight you hid but you are what you did and ill forget you but ill never forgive the smallest man who ever lived,true gazing starryeyed jehovahs witness suit fuck guy tried buy pills friend friends mine ghosted know feels like dont even want back want know rusting sparkling summer goal dont miss could someone give message smallest man ever lived hung wall stabbed push pins public showed sank stoned oblivion cause queen come youd treat like alsoran didnt measure measure man dont even want back want know rusting sparkling summer goal dont miss could someone give message smallest man ever lived sent someone wanted dead sleep gun underneath bed writin book sleeper cell spy fifty years declassified youll confess ill say good riddance cause wasnt sexy wasnt forbidden wouldve died sins instead died inside deserve prison wont get time youll slide inboxes slip bars crashed party rental car said normal girls boring gone morning kicked stage lights youre still performing plain sight hid ill forget ill never forgive smallest man ever lived,smallest man ever lived
The Alchemy,The Tortured Poets Department,"This happens once every few lifetimes
These chemicals hit me like white wine
What if I told you I'm back?
The hospital was a drag
Worst sleep that I ever had
I circled you on a map
I haven't come around in so long
But I'm coming back so strong

[Chorus]
So when I touch down
Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
Ditch the clowns, get the crown
Baby, I'm the one to beat
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?

[Verse 2]
Hey, you, what if I told you we're cool?
That child's play back in school
Is forgiven under my rule
I haven't come around in so long
But I'm making a comeback to where I belong

[Chorus]
So when I touch down
Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
Ditch the clowns, get the crown
Baby, I'm the one to beat
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?
These blokes warm the benches
We've been on a winning streak
He jokes that it's heroin, but this time with an ""E""
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?

[Bridge]
Shirts off and your friends lift you up over their heads
Beer stickin' to the floor, cheers chanted 'cause they said
""There was no chance trying to be the greatest in the league""
Where's the trophy? He just comes runnin' over to me

[Chorus]
Touchdown
Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
Ditch the clowns, get the crown
Baby, I'm the one to beat
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?
These blokes warm the benches
We've been on a winning streak

You'd be picked like a rose?""

[Pre-Chorus]
""I'm not trying to exaggerate
But I think I might die if it happened
Die if it happened to me
No one in my small town
Thought I'd see the lights of Manhattan""

Breath of fresh air through smoke rings
Take the glory, give everything
Promise to be dazzling""

""You look like Stevie Nicks
In '75, the hair and lips
Crowd goes wild at her fingertips
Half moonshine, a full eclipse""

No one in my small town thought I'd meet these suits in L.A.
They all wanna say...""

[Chorus]
""This town is fake, but you're the real thing
Breath of fresh air through smoke rings
Take the glory, give everything

The crown is stained, but you're the real queen
Flesh and blood amongst war machines
You're the new god we're worshipping
Promise to be dazzling""

[Bridge]
Beauty is a beast that roars down on all fours
Demanding more
Only when your girlish glow flickers just so
Do they let you know
It's hell on earth to be heavenly
Them's the breaks, they don't come gently

The Black Dog,The Tortured Poets Department,"I am someone who until recent events
You shared your secrets with
And your location, you forgot to turn it off
And so I watch as you walk
Into some bar called The Black Dog
And pierce new holes in my heart
You forgot to turn it off
And it hits me

[Chorus]
I just don't understand
How you don't miss me in The Black Dog
When someone plays ""The Starting Line""
And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song
That was intertwined in the magic fabric of our dreaming
Old habits die screaming

[Verse 2]
I move through the world with the heartbroken
My longings stay unspoken
And I may never open up the way I did for you
And all of those best laid plans
You said I needed a brave man
Then proceeded to play him
Until I believed it too
And it kills me

[Chorus]
I just don't understand
How you don't miss me in the shower
And remember how my rain-soaked body
Was shakin', do you hate me?
Was it hazing? For a cruel fraternity
I pledged and I still mean it
Old habits die screaming

[Bridge]
Six weeks of breathin' clean air
I still miss the smoke
Were you makin' fun of me
With some esoteric joke?
Now I wanna sell my house
And set fire to all my clothes
And hire a priest to come and exorcise my demons
Even if I die screaming
And I hope you hear it

[Chorus]
And I hope it's shitty in The Black Dog
When someone plays ""The Starting Line""
And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song
That was intertwined in the tragic fabric of our dreaming
'Cause tail between your legs, you're leavin'

I still can't believe it

Or I might just love you 'til the end

Bygones will be bygone, eras fadin' into gray (Fading into gray)
We broke all the pieces, but still wanna play the game (Oh)
Told my friends I hate you, but I love you just the same
Pick your poison, babe, I'm poison either way

The Albatross,The Tortured Poets Department,"Wise men once said
""Wild winds are death to the candle""
A rose by any other name is a scandal
Cautions issued, he stood
Shooting the messengers
They tried to warn him about her

[Chorus]
Cross your thoughtless heart
Only liquor anoints you
She's the albatross
She is here to destroy you

[Verse 2]
Wise men once said
""One bad seed kills the garden""
""One less temptress, one less dagger to sharpen""
Locked me up in towers
But I'd visit in your dreams
And they tried to warn you about me

[Chorus]
Cross your thoughtless heart
Only liquor anoints you
She's the albatross
She is here to destroy you
Devils that you know
Raise worse hell than a stranger
She's the death you chose
You're in terrible danger

[Bridge]
And when that sky rains fire on you
And you're persona non grata
I'll tell you how I've been there too
And that none of it matters

[Verse 3]
Wise men once read fake news
And they believed it
Jackals raised their hackles
You couldn't conceive it
You were sleeping soundly
When they dragged you from your bed
And I tried to warn you about them

[Chorus]
So I crossed my thoughtless heart
Spread my wings like a parachute
I'm the albatross
I swept in at the rescue
The devil that you know
Looks now more like an angel
I'm the life you chose
And all this terrible danger
(This terrible danger)

Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus,The Tortured Poets Department,"Your hologram stumbled into my apartment
Hands in the hair of somebody in darkness
Named Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus
And I just watched it happen
As the decade would play us for fools
And you saw my bones out with somebody new
Who seemed like he would've bullied you in school
And you just watched it happen

[Chorus]
If you wanna break my cold, cold heart
Just say, ""I loved you the way that you were""
If you wanna tear my world apart
Just say you've always wondered

[Verse 2]
You said some things that I can't unabsorb
You turned me into an idea of sorts
You needed me, but you needed drugs more
And I couldn't watch it happen
I changed into goddesses, villains, and fools
Changed plans and lovers and outfits and rules
All to outrun my desertion of you
And you just watched it

[Chorus]
If you wanna break my cold, cold heart
Just say, ""I loved you the way that you were""
If you wanna tear my world apart
Just say you've always wondered

[Bridge]
If the glint in my eye traced the depths of your sigh
Down that passage in time back to the moment
I crashed into you, like so many wrecks do
Too impaired by my youth to know what to do

[Verse 3]
So if I sell my apartment
And you have some kids with an internet starlet
Will that make your memory fade from this scarlet maroon
Like it never happened?
Could it be enough to just float in your orbit?
Can we watch our phantoms like watching wild horses?
Cooler in theory, but not if you force it to be
It just didn't happen

[Chorus]
So if you wanna break my cold, cold heart
Say you loved me
And if you wanna tear my world apart
Say you'll always wonder
[Outro]
'Cause I wonder
Will I always
Will I always wonder?",your hologram stumbled into my apartment hands in the hair of somebody in darkness named chloe or sam or sophia or marcus and i just watched it happen as the decade would play us for fools and you saw my bones out with somebody new who seemed like he wouldve bullied you in school and you just watched it happen if you wanna break my cold cold heart just say i loved you the way that you were if you wanna tear my world apart just say youve always wondered you said some things that i cant unabsorb you turned me into an idea of sorts you needed me but you needed drugs more and i couldnt watch it happen i changed into goddesses villains and fools changed plans and lovers and outfits and rules all to outrun my desertion of you and you just watched it if you wanna break my cold cold heart just say i loved you the way that you were if you wanna tear my world apart just say youve always wondered if the glint in my eye traced the depths of your sigh down that passage in time back to the moment i crashed into you like so many wrecks do too impaired by my youth to know what to do so if i sell my apartment and you have some kids with an internet starlet will that make your memory fade from this scarlet maroon like it never happened could it be enough to just float in your orbit can we watch our phantoms like watching wild horses cooler in theory but not if you force it to be it just didnt happen so if you wanna break my cold cold heart say you loved me and if you wanna tear my world apart say youll always wonder cause i wonder will i always will i always wonder,hologram stumbled apartment hands hair somebody darkness named chloe sam sophia marcus watched happen decade would play us fools saw bones somebody new seemed like wouldve bullied school watched happen wanna break cold cold heart say loved way wanna tear world apart say youve always wondered said things cant unabsorb turned idea sorts needed needed drugs couldnt watch happen changed goddesses villains fools changed plans lovers outfits rules outrun desertion watched wanna break cold cold heart say loved way wanna tear world apart say youve always wondered glint eye traced depths sigh passage time back moment crashed like many wrecks impaired youth know sell apartment kids internet starlet make memory fade scarlet maroon like never happened could enough float orbit watch phantoms like watching wild horses cooler theory force didnt happen wanna break cold cold heart say loved wanna tear world apart say youll always wonder cause wonder always always wonder,chloe sam sophia marcus
How Did It End?,The Tortured Poets Department,"(Uh-oh, uh-oh)

[Verse 1]
We hereby conduct this post-mortem
He was a hot house flower to my outdoorsman
Our maladies were such we could not cure them
And so a touch that was my birthright became foreign

[Chorus]
Come one, come all, it's happenin' again
The empathetic hunger descends
We'll tell no one except all of our friends
We must know
How did it end?
(Uh-oh, uh-oh)

[Verse 2]
We were blind to unforeseen circumstances
We learned the right steps to different dances
And fell victim to interlopers' glances
Lost the game of chance, what are the chances?
Soon, they'll go home to their husbands
Smug 'cause they know they can trust him
Then feverishly calling their cousins

[Chorus]
""Guess who we ran into at the shops?
Walking in circles like she was lost
Didn't you hear? They called it all off""
One gasp and then
""How did it end?""

[Bridge]
Say it once again with feeling
How the death rattle breathing
Silenced as the soul was leaving
The deflation of our dreaming
Leaving me bereft and reeling
My beloved ghost and me
Sitting in a tree
D-Y-I-N-G

[Pre-Chorus]
It's happenin' again
How did it end?
I can't pretend like I understand
How did it end?

[Chorus]
Come one, come all, it's happenin' again

So High School,The Tortured Poets Department,"I feel so high school every time I look at you
I wanna find you in a crowd just to hide from you

[Chorus]
And in a blink of a crinklin' eye
I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined
Cheeks pink in the twinklin' lights
Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me
I'll drink what you think and I'm high
From smokin' your jokes all damn night
The brink of a wrinkle in time
Bittersweet sixteen suddenly

I Hate It Here,The Tortured Poets Department,"Quick, quick, tell me something awful
Like you are a poet trapped inside the body of a finance guy
Tell me all your secrets, all you'll ever be is
My eternal consolation prize
You see, I was a debutante in another life, but
Now I seem to be scared to go outside
If comfort is a construct, I don't believe in good luck
Now that I know what's what

[Chorus]
I hate it here so I will go to secret gardens in my mind
People need a key to get to, the only one is mine
I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child
No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
I hate it here

[Verse 2]
My friends used to play a game where
We would pick a decade
We wished we could live in instead of this
I'd say the 1830s but without all the racists
And getting married off for the highest bid
Everyone would look down 'cause it wasn't fun now
Seems like it was never even fun back then
Nostalgia is a mind's trick
If I'd been there, I'd hate it
It was freezing in the palace

[Chorus]
I hate it here so I will go to lunar valleys in my mind
When they found a better planet, only the gentle survived
I dreamed about it in the dark, the night I felt like I might die
No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
I hate it here

[Bridge]
I'm lonely, but I'm good
I'm bitter, but I swear I'm fine
I'll save all my romanticism for my inner life and I'll get lost on purpose
This place made me feel worthless
Lucid dreams like electricity, the current flies through me
And in my fantasies, I rise above it
And way up there, I actually love it

[Chorus]
I hate it here so I will go to secret gardens in my mind
People need a key to get to, the only one is mine
I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child
No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
I hate it here

thanK you aIMee,The Tortured Poets Department,"When I picture my hometown
There's a bronze, spray-tanned statue of you
And a plaque underneath it
That threatens to push me down the stairs at our school

[Pre-Chorus]
And it was always the same searing pain
But I dreamed that one day I could say

[Chorus]
All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
And I can't forgive the way you made me feel
Screamed, ""Fuck you, Aimee"" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
But I can't forget the way you made me heal

[Verse 2]
And it wasn't a fair fight
Or a clean kill each time that Aimee stomped across my grave
And then she wrote headlines
In the local paper, laughing at each baby step I'd take

[Pre-Chorus]
And it was always the same searing pain
But I prayed that one day I could say

[Chorus]
All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
And I couldn't wait to show you it was real
Screamed, ""Fuck you, Aimee"" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
But I can't forget the way you made me heal
Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead
I pushed each boulder up the hill
Your words are still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head

[Bridge]
I wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool
I built a legacy that you can't undo
But when I count the scars, there's a moment of truth
That there wouldn't be this if there hadn't been you

[Verse 3]
And maybe you've reframed it
And in your mind, you never beat my spirit black and blue
I don't think you've changed much
And so I changed your name and any real defining clues
And one day, your kid comes home singin'
A song that only us two is gonna know is about you, 'cause

[Chorus]
All that time you were throwin' punches, it was all for nothin'
And our town, it looks so small from way up here
Screamed, ""Thank you, Aimee"" to the night sky and the stars are stunnin'
'Cause I can't forget the way you made me heal
Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead
So I pushed each boulder up that hill
Your words were still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head

I Look in People's Windows,The Tortured Poets Department,"I had died the tiniest death
I spied the catch in your breath
Out, out, out, out, out, out
Northbound I got carried away
As you boarded your train
South, south, south, south, south, south

[Pre-Chorus]
A feather taken by the wind blowing
I'm afflicted by the not knowing, so

[Chorus]
I look in people's windows
Transfixed by rose golden glows
They have their friends over to drink nice wine
I look in people's windows
In case you're at their table
What if your eyes looked up and met mine
One more time?

[Verse 2]
You had stopped and tilted your head
I still ponder what it meant
Now, now, now, now, now, now
I tried searching faces on streets
What are the chances you'd be
Downtown, downtown, downtown

[Pre-Chorus]
Does it feel alright to not know me?
I'm addicted to the ""if only""

[Chorus]
So I look in people's windows
Like I'm some deranged weirdo
I attend Christmas parties from outside
I look in people's windows
In case you're at their table

The Prophecy,The Tortured Poets Department,"One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Hand on the throttle
Thought I caught lightning in a bottle
Oh, but it's gone again
And it was written
I got cursed like Eve got bitten
Oh, was it punishment?
Pad around when I get home
I guess a lesser woman would've lost hope
A greater woman wouldn't beg
But I looked to the sky and said

[Chorus]
""Please
I've been on my knees
Change the prophecy
Don't want money
Just someone who wants my company
Let it once be me
Who do I have to speak to
About if they can redo the prophecy?""

[Verse 2]
Cards on the table
Mine play out like fools in a fable
Oh, it was sinking in (Sinking in, oh)
Slow is the quicksand
Poison blood from the wound of the pricked hand
Oh, still I dream of him

[Chorus]
Please
I've been on my knees
Change the prophecy
Don't want money
Just someone who wants my company
Let it once be me
Who do I have to speak to
About if they can redo the prophecy?

[Bridge]
And I sound like an infant
Feeling like the very last drops of an ink pen
A greater woman stays cool
But I howl like a wolf at the moon
And I look unstable
Gathered with a coven 'round a sorceress' table
A greater woman has faith
But even statues crumble if they're made to wait
I'm so afraid I sealed my fate
No sign of soulmates
I'm just a paperweight in shades of greige
Spending my last coin so someone will tell me it'll be okay
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Please
I've been on my knees
Change the prophecy
Don't want money
Just someone who wants my company
Let it once be me
Who do I have to speak to
About if they can redo the prophecy?
Who do I have to speak to
To change the prophecy?
[Outro]
Hand on the throttle

Cassandra,The Tortured Poets Department,"I was in my new house placing daydreams
Patching up the crack along the wall
I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying
'Cause that's where I was when I got the call

[Pre-Chorus]
When the first stone's thrown, there's screamin'
In the streets, there's a raging riot
When it's ""Burn the bitch,"" they're shrieking
When the truth comes out, it's quiet

[Chorus]
So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
And tried to tell the town
So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say
Do you believe me now?

[Verse 2]
I was in my tower weaving nightmares
Twisting all my smiles into snarls
They say, ""What doesn't kill you makes you aware""
What happens if it becomes who you are?

[Chorus]
So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
And tried to tell the town
So they set my life in flames, I regret to say
Do you believe me now?

[Bridge]
They knew, they knew, they knew the whole time
That I was onto somethin'
The family, the pure greed, the Christian chorus line
They all said nothin'
Blood's thick, but nothin' like a payroll
Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul
You can mark my words that I said it first
In a mourning warning, no one heard

[Verse 3]
I patched up the crack along the wall
I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying
'Cause that's where I was when I lost it all

[Chorus]
So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
And tried to tell the town
So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say
Do you believe me now?

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah
I was onto somethin'
Ah, ah
They all said nothin'
Blood's thick but nothin' like a payroll
Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul
You can mark my words that I said it first
In a mourning warning, no one heard
No one heard, not a single word was heard
[Outro]
When the first stone's thrown, there's screamin'
In the streets, there's a raging riot

Peter,The Tortured Poets Department,"Forgive me, Peter
My lost fearless leader
In closets like cedar
Preserved from when we were just kids
Is it somethin' I did?
The goddess of timing
Once found us beguiling
She said she was trying
Peter, was she lying?
My ribs get the feeling she did

[Pre-Chorus]
And I didn't wanna come down
I thought it was just goodbye for now

[Chorus]
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Words from the mouths of babes
Promises oceans-deep
But never to keep
Oh, never to keep

[Verse 2]
Are you still a mind reader?
A natural scene-stealer?
I've heard great things, Peter
But life was always easier on you
Than it was on me
And sometimes it gets me
When crossing your jet stream
We both did the best we could do
Underneath the same moon
In different galaxies

[Pre-Chorus]
And I didn't wanna hang around
We said it was just goodbye for now

[Chorus]
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Words from the mouths of babes
Promises oceans-deep
But never to keep
Never to keep
[Bridge]
And I won't confess that I waited, but I let the lamp burn
As the men masqueraded, I hoped you'd return
With your feet on the ground, tell me all that you'd learned
'Cause love's never lost when perspective is earned
And you said you'd come and get me, but you were twenty-five
And the shelf life of those fantasies has expired
Lost to the ""Lost Boys"" chapter of your life
Forgive me, Peter, please know that I tried
To hold on (Hold on) to the days (To the days)
When you were mine
But the woman who sits by the window
Has turned out the light

[Chorus]
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Words from the mouths of babes
Promises oceans-deep

The Bolter,The Tortured Poets Department,"By all accounts, she almost drowned
When she was six in frigid water
And I can confirm she made
A curious child, ever reviled
By everyone except her own father
With a quite bewitching face
Splendidly selfish, charmingly helpless
Excellent fun 'til you get to know her
Then she runs like it's a race
Behind her back, her best mates laughed
And they nicknamed her ""The Bolter""

[Chorus]
Started with a kiss
""Oh, we must stop meeting like this""
But it always ends up with a town car speeding
Out the drive one evening
Ended with the slam of a door
Then he'll call her a whore
Wish he wouldn't be sore
But as she was leaving
It felt like breathing

[Post-Chorus]
All her fuckin' lives
Flashed before her eyes
It feels like the time
She fell through the ice
Then came out alive

[Verse 2]
He was a cad, wanted her bad
Just like any good trophy hunter
And she liked the way it tastes
Taming a bear, making him care
Watching him jump then pulling him under
And at first blush, this is fate
When it's all roses, portrait poses
Central Park Lake in tiny rowboats
What a charming Saturday
That's when she sees the littlest leaks
Down in the floorboards
And she just knows she must bolt

[Chorus]
Started with a kiss
""Oh, we must stop meeting like this""
But it always ends up with a town car speeding
Out the drive one evening
Ended with the slam of a door
Then he'll call her a whore
Wish he wouldn't be sore
But as she was leaving
It felt like breathing

[Post-Chorus]
All her fuckin' lives
Flashed before her eyes (Ah-ah-ah)
It feels like the time
She fell through the ice
Then came out alive
[Bridge]
She's been many places with
Men of many faces
First, they're off to the races
And she's laughing, drawin' aces
But none of it is changin'
That the chariot is waitin'
Hearts are hers for the breakin'
There's escape in escaping

[Chorus]
Started with a kiss
""Oh, we must stop meeting like this""
But it always ends up with a town car speeding
Out the drive one evenin'
Ended with the slam of a door
But she's got the best stories
You can be sure
That as she was leaving
It felt like freedom

All her fuckin' lives
Flashed before her eyes (And she realized)
It feels like the time

Robin,The Tortured Poets Department,"Long may you reign
You're an animal, you are bloodthirsty
Out window panes talking utter nonsense
You have no idea

Strings tied to levers
Slowed-down clocks tethered
All this showmanship

Way to go, tiger
Higher and higher
Wilder and lighter

Long may you roar
At your dinosaurs
You're a just ruler
Covered in mud, you look ridiculous
And you have no idea

Buried down deep
And out of your reach
The secret we all vowed
To keep it from you in sweetness

You got the dragonflies above your bed
You have a favorite spot on the swing set
You have no room in your dreams for regrets

The Manuscript,The Tortured Poets Department,"Now and then, she rereads the manuscript
Of the entire torrid affair
They compared their licenses
He said, ""I'm not a donor but
I'd give you my heart if you needed it""
She rolled her eyes and said
""You're a professional""
He said, ""No, just a good samaritan""
He said that if the sex was half as good as the conversation was
Soon, they'd be pushin' strollers
But, soon, it was over

[Verse 2]
In the age of him, she wished she was thirty
And made coffee every morning in a French press
Afterwards, she only ate kids' cereal
And couldn't sleep unless it was in her mother's bed
Then she dated boys who were her own age
With dart boards on the backs of their doors
She thought about how he said since she was so wise beyond her years
Everything had been above board
She wasn't sure

[Bridge]
And the years passed like scenes of a show
The professor said to write what you know
Lookin' backwards might be the only way to move forward
Then the actors were hitting their marks
And the slow dance was alight with the sparks
And the tears fell in synchronicity with the score
And at last, she knew what the agony had been for

[Outro]
The only thing that's left is the manuscript
One last souvenir from my trip to your shores
Now and then, I reread the manuscript
But the story isn't mine anymore",now and then she rereads the manuscript of the entire torrid affair they compared their licenses he said im not a donor but id give you my heart if you needed it she rolled her eyes and said youre a professional he said no just a good samaritan he said that if the sex was half as good as the conversation was soon theyd be pushin strollers but soon it was over in the age of him she wished she was thirty and made coffee every morning in a french press afterwards she only ate kids cereal and couldnt sleep unless it was in her mothers bed then she dated boys who were her own age with dart boards on the backs of their doors she thought about how he said since she was so wise beyond her years everything had been above board she wasnt sure and the years passed like scenes of a show the professor said to write what you know lookin backwards might be the only way to move forward then the actors were hitting their marks and the slow dance was alight with the sparks and the tears fell in synchronicity with the score and at last she knew what the agony had been for the only thing thats left is the manuscript one last souvenir from my trip to your shores now and then i reread the manuscript but the story isnt mine anymore,rereads manuscript entire torrid affair compared licenses said im donor id give heart needed rolled eyes said youre professional said good samaritan said sex half good conversation soon theyd pushin strollers soon age wished thirty made coffee every morning french press afterwards ate kids cereal couldnt sleep unless mothers bed dated boys age dart boards backs doors thought said since wise beyond years everything board wasnt sure years passed like scenes show professor said write know lookin backwards might way move forward actors hitting marks slow dance alight sparks tears fell synchronicity score last knew agony thing thats left manuscript one last souvenir trip shores reread manuscript story isnt mine anymore,manuscript
Last Christmas,The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,"Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shied
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me
Well, it has been a year, it does not surprise me
Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kiss me now, I know you would fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

[Verse 2]
A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
I am hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year
Maybe this year I will give it to someone special

[Chorus]
Because last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

And last Christmas
And this year
It won't be anything like, anything like

Christmases When You Were Mine,The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,"Please take down the mistletoe
'Cause I don't want to think about that right now
'Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me
Season's greetings, hope you're well
Well I'm doing alright
If you were wondering
Lately I can never tell

[Chorus]
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine

[Verse 2]
I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
And everybody's here, except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold

[Chorus]
But for me it's just a lonely time
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

[Verse 3]
Merry Christmas, everybody
That'll have to be something I just say this year
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again?
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands?

Christmas Must Be Something More,The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection,"What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing?
Would the song still survive without five golden rings?
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?
What would happen if God never let it snow?
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie?
Tell me, what would you find?

[Chorus]
You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

[Verse 2]
What if angels did not pay attention to
All the things that we wished they would always do?
What if happiness came in a cardboard box?
Then I think there is something we all forgot
What would happen if presents all went away?
Tell me, what would you find?

[Chorus]
You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

[Bridge]
We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships
Hundred-mile-an-hour lives
And it's this time of year
And everybody's here
It seems the last thing on your mind

[Chorus]
Is that the day holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
But here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more

Eyes Open (Taylor's Version),The Hunger Games,"Everybody's waitin'
Everybody's watchin'

Keep your eyes open

The tricky thing
Is yesterday, we were just children
Playing soldiers, just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards
Winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score

But turn around (Turn around)
Oh, they've surrounded you, it's a showdown (Showdown)
And nobody comes to save you now

Yeah, you got somethin' they don't

Renegade,How Long Do You Think It's Gonna Last,"I tapped on your window on your darkest night
The shape of you was jagged and weak
There was nowhere for me to stay, but I stayed anyway
And if I would've known
How many pieces you had crumbled into
I might have let them lay

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it's time
You've come a long way, open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
Is it insensitive for me to say
""Get your shit together so I can love you""?
Is it really your anxiety that stops you
From giving me everything
Or do you just not want to?

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I tapped on your window on your darkest night
The shape of you was jagged and weak

Beautiful Ghosts,Cats,"Follow me home if you dare to
I wouldn't know where to lead you
Should I take chances when no one took chances on me?
So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start
With no beauty in my memory

[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

[Verse 2]
Perilous night, their voices calling
A flicker of light before the dawning
Out here, the wild ones are taming the fear within me
Scared to call them my friends and be broken again
Is this hope just a mystical dream?

[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

[Bridge]
And so maybe my home isn't what I had known
What I thought it would be
But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night
And I know that this life isn't safe, but it's wild and it's free

[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
I'll never wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
With them, I have something, something to cling to
I never knew I'd love this world they've let me into
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts",follow me home if you dare to i wouldnt know where to lead you should i take chances when no one took chances on me so i watch from the dark wait for my life to start with no beauty in my memory all that i wanted was to be wanted too young to wander london streets alone and haunted born into nothing at least you have something something to cling to visions of dazzling rooms ill never get let into and the memories were lost long ago but at least you have beautiful ghosts perilous night their voices calling a flicker of light before the dawning out here the wild ones are taming the fear within me scared to call them my friends and be broken again is this hope just a mystical dream all that i wanted was to be wanted too young to wander london streets alone and haunted born into nothing at least you have something something to cling to visions of dazzling rooms ill never get let into and the memories were lost long ago but at least you have beautiful ghosts and so maybe my home isnt what i had known what i thought it would be but i feel so alive with these phantoms of night and i know that this life isnt safe but its wild and its free all that i wanted was to be wanted ill never wander london streets alone and haunted born into nothing with them i have something something to cling to i never knew id love this world theyve let me into and the memories were lost long ago so ill dance with these beautiful ghosts and the memories were lost long ago so ill dance with these beautiful ghosts,follow home dare wouldnt know lead take chances one took chances watch dark wait life start beauty memory wanted wanted young wander london streets alone haunted born nothing least something something cling visions dazzling rooms ill never get let memories lost long ago least beautiful ghosts perilous night voices calling flicker light dawning wild ones taming fear within scared call friends broken hope mystical dream wanted wanted young wander london streets alone haunted born nothing least something something cling visions dazzling rooms ill never get let memories lost long ago least beautiful ghosts maybe home isnt known thought would feel alive phantoms night know life isnt safe wild free wanted wanted ill never wander london streets alone haunted born nothing something something cling never knew id love world theyve let memories lost long ago ill dance beautiful ghosts memories lost long ago ill dance beautiful ghosts,beautiful ghosts
Macavity,Cats,"Macavity's a mystery cat, he's called the Hiddenpaw
For he's the master criminal who can defy the law
He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair
For when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity
His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare
But when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin
You would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunken in
His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed
His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed
He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake
And when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
For he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity's not there

[Bridge: Taylor Swift]
He's outwardly respectable, I know, he cheats at cards
And his footprints are not found in any files of Scotland Yard's
And when the larder's looted and the jewel case is rifled
Or when the milk is missing or another peke's been stifled
Or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair
There's the wonder of the thing, Macavity's not there

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Idris Elba & Both]
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity
He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare
What ever time the deed took place, Macavity wasn't there
And they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
I might mention Mungojerrie, Rumpleteazer, Griddlebone
Are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time
Just controls the operations, the Napoleon of Crime
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity, Macavity
Macavity, Macavity

Carolina,Where The Crawdads Sing,"Oh, Carolina creeks running through my veins
Lost I was born, lonesome I came
Lonesome I'll always stay
Carolina knows why, for years, I roam
Free as these birds, light as whispers
Carolina knows

[Pre-Chorus]
And you didn't see me here
No, they never did see me here
And she's in my dreams

[Chorus]
Into the mist, into the clouds
Don't leave
I make a fist, I'll make it count
And there are places I will never, ever go
And things that only Carolina will ever know

[Verse 2]
Carolina stains on the dress she left
Indelible scars, pivotal marks
Blue as the life she fled
Carolina pines, won't you cover me?
Hide me like robes down the back road
Muddy these webs we weave

[Pre-Chorus]
And you didn't see me here
Oh, they never did see me
And she's in my dreams

[Chorus]
Into the mist, into the clouds
Don't leave
I make a fist, I'll make it count
And there are places I will never, ever go
And things that only Carolina will ever know

[Bridge]
And you didn't see me here
They never did see me here
No, you didn't see me here
They never saw me

[Outro]

That I was guilty as sin and sleep in a liar's bed
But the sleep comes fast and I'll meet no ghosts
It's between me, the sand, and the sea

Christmas Tree Farm,Christmas Tree Farm,"My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

[Verse 1]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

[Verse 2]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah

[Bridge]
And when I'm feelin' alone
You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you)

Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""

Only The Young,Miss Americana,"It keeps me awake, the look on your face
The moment you heard the news
You're screaming inside and frozen in time
You did all that you could do
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think they're right
You were outnumbered this time

[Chorus]
But only the young, only the young
Only the young, only the young
Can run
Can run
So run, and run, and run

[Verse 2]
So every day now
You brace for the sound you've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly they forget

[Pre-Chorus]
They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun

[Chorus]
Only one thing can save us
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young
Only the young (Only the young; Don't say you're too tired to fight)
Only the young (Only the young; It's just a matter of time)
Only the young (Only the young; Up there's the finish line)
Only the young
Can run

[Post-Chorus]
Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (Can run)
Up there's the finish line (So run, and run, and run)
Don't say you're too tired to fight

Two Is Better Than One,Love Drunk,"I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought
""Hey, you know, this could be something""
'Cause everything you do and words you say
You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing

[Chorus: Martin Johnson & Taylor Swift]
So maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one

[Verse 2: Martin Johnson & Taylor Swift]
I remember every look upon your face
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay
I'm finally now believing

[Chorus: Martin Johnson & Taylor Swift]
Then maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one

[Bridge: Martin Johnson]
I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought, hey (Hey, hey)

But you're such a tease
Throw the keys back to me
Go on and kick off your boots
In the passenger seat

You know I get sad
And I can't look past what I'm sad about

Highway Don't Care,Two Lanes of Freedom,"Bet your window's rolled down and your hair's pulled back

Bad Blood (Remix) (Taylor's Version),1989 (Taylor's Version),"'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love (Uh)
So take a look what you've done (Uh)
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood (Uh), hey (Hey)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I can't take it back, look where I'm at (Uh)
We was OG like D.O.C., remember that? (Remember that?)
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts (ID my)
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you, but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more, no, I don't fear no more
Better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more

Think about the good times

Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember? Oh, wait, you've got amnesia?

Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumpin' through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now (Haha)

Paris,Midnights,"""Your ex-friend's sister
Met someone at a club and he kissed her
Turns out, it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago
Some wannabe Z-lister
And all the outfits were terrible
2003 unbearable
Did you see the photos?""
No, I didn't, but thanks, though

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
Stumbled down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne
I was taken by the view

[Chorus]
Like we were in Paris
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris, oh
We were somewhere else

[Verse 2]
Privacy sign on the door
And on my page and on the whole world
Romance is not dead if you keep it just yours
Levitate above all the messes made
Sit quiet by my side in the shade
And not the kind that's thrown
I mean, the kind under where a tree has grown

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
Stumbled down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne
I was taken by the view

[Chorus]
Like we were in Paris, oh
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris, oh
We were somewhere else

[Bridge]
I wanna brainwash you
Into loving me forever
I wanna transport you
To somewhere the culture's clever
Confess my truth
In swooping, sloping, cursive letters
Let the only flashing lights be the tower at midnight
In my mind

[Breakdown]
We drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
In an alleyway, drinking champagne
[Chorus]
'Cause we were in Paris
Yes, we were somewhere else

Glitch,Midnights,"We were supposed to be just friends
You don't live in my part of town, but maybe I'll see you out some weekend
Depending on what kind of mood and situationship I'm in
And what's in my system

[Chorus]
I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah
Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah
And I'm not even sorry, nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
I was supposed to sweat you out
In search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone else's playground
But it's been two-thousand one-hundred ninety days of our love blackout
(Our love is blacking out)
The system's breaking down
(The system's breaking down)

[Chorus]
I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah
Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah
And I'm not even sorry, nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch

[Bridge]
A brief interruption, a slight malfunction
I'd go back to wanting dudes who give nothing
I thought we had no chance
And that's romance, let's dance

[Chorus]
Glitch, oh, yeah
Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah

Crazier,The Hannah Montana Movie,"I'd never gone with the wind, just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you open the door, there's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was tryin' to fly but I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

[Chorus]
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

[Verse 2]
I've watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me somethin' that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes
And you made me believe

[Chorus]
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier, oh

[Bridge]
Baby, you showed me what livin' is for
I don't wanna hide anymore
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
Crazier, crazier",id never gone with the wind just let it flow let it take me where it wants to go til you open the door theres so much more id never seen it before i was tryin to fly but i couldnt find wings but you came along and you changed everything you lift my feet off the ground you spin me around you make me crazier crazier feels like im fallin and i am lost in your eyes you make me crazier crazier crazier ive watched from a distance as you made life your own every sky was your own kind of blue and i wanted to know how that would feel and you made it so real you showed me somethin that i couldnt see you opened my eyes and you made me believe you lift my feet off the ground you spin me around you make me crazier crazier feels like im fallin and i am lost in your eyes you make me crazier crazier crazier oh baby you showed me what livin is for i dont wanna hide anymore ohoh you lift my feet off the ground you spin me around you make me crazier crazier feels like im fallin and i am lost in your eyes you make me crazier crazier crazier crazier crazier,id never gone wind let flow let take wants go til open door theres much id never seen tryin fly couldnt find wings came along changed everything lift feet ground spin around make crazier crazier feels like im fallin lost eyes make crazier crazier crazier ive watched distance made life every sky kind blue wanted know would feel made real showed somethin couldnt see opened eyes made believe lift feet ground spin around make crazier crazier feels like im fallin lost eyes make crazier crazier crazier oh baby showed livin dont wanna hide anymore ohoh lift feet ground spin around make crazier crazier feels like im fallin lost eyes make crazier crazier crazier crazier crazier,crazier
If This Was a Movie (Taylor's Version),Fearless (Taylor's Version),"Last night, I heard my own heart beatin'
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reachin'
Even though I know you're not there
I was playin' back a thousand memories, baby
Thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

[Verse 2]
I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends are laughin'
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Back before I knew how much I had to lose

[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

[Bridge]
If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just wanna see you back at my front door

[Breakdown]
And I say, ""Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out""
But I take it all back now

[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now
[Outro]
You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby, what about the ending?
Oh, I thought that you'd be here by now
Oh, oh
Thought you'd be here by now",last night i heard my own heart beatin sounded like footsteps on my stairs six months gone and im still reachin even though i know youre not there i was playin back a thousand memories baby thinkin bout everything weve been through maybe ive been going back too much lately when time stood still and i had you come back come back come back to me like you would you would if this was a movie stand in the rain outside til i came out come back come back come back to me like you could you could if you just said youre sorry i know that we could work it out somehow but if this was a movie youd be here by now i know people change and these things happen but i remember how it was back then wrapped up in your arms and our friends are laughin cause nothing like this ever happened to them now im pacing down the hall chasing down your street flashback to the night when you said to me nothings gonna change not for me and you back before i knew how much i had to lose come back come back come back to me like you would you would if this was a movie stand in the rain outside til i came out come back come back come back to me like you could you could if you just said youre sorry i know that we could work it out somehow but if this was a movie youd be here by now if youre out there if youre somewhere if youre moving on ive been waiting for you every day since youve been gone i just want it back the way it was before and i just wanna see you back at my front door and i say come back come back come back to me like you would before you said its not that easy before the fight before i locked you out but i take it all back now come back come back come back to me like you would you would if this was a movie stand in the rain outside til i came out come back come back come back to me like you could you could if you just said youre sorry i know that we could work it out somehow but if this was a movie youd be here by now youd be here by now its not the kind of ending you wanna see now baby what about the ending oh i thought that youd be here by now oh oh thought youd be here by now,last night heard heart beatin sounded like footsteps stairs six months gone im still reachin even though know youre playin back thousand memories baby thinkin bout everything weve maybe ive going back much lately time stood still come back come back come back like would would movie stand rain outside til came come back come back come back like could could said youre sorry know could work somehow movie youd know people change things happen remember back wrapped arms friends laughin cause nothing like ever happened im pacing hall chasing street flashback night said nothings gonna change back knew much lose come back come back come back like would would movie stand rain outside til came come back come back come back like could could said youre sorry know could work somehow movie youd youre youre somewhere youre moving ive waiting every day since youve gone want back way wanna see back front door say come back come back come back like would said easy fight locked take back come back come back come back like would would movie stand rain outside til came come back come back come back like could could said youre sorry know could work somehow movie youd youd kind ending wanna see baby ending oh thought youd oh oh thought youd,movie (taylor's version)
